During the Depression, President Roosevelt decided to devalue the dollar against gold. In order to pull this off, the government had to control the entire gold market, and for a time the government made it illegal to own gold coins. Later on the ability to redeem the notes for gold was restricted to just banks, then to just foreign banks, and then finally to no one.

The next Fourth Turning is due to begin shortly after the new millennium, midway through the Oh-Oh decade. Around the year 2005, a sudden spark will catalyze a Crisis mood. Remnants of the old social order will disintegrate. Political and economic trust will implode. Real hardship will beset the land, with severe distress that could involve questions of class, race, nation, and empire.

History's howling storms can bring out the worst and best in a society. The next Fourth Turning could literally destroy us as a nation and people, leaving us cursed in the histories of those who endure and remember. Alternatively, it could ennoble our lives, elevate us as a community, and inspire acts of consummate heroism—deeds that will grow into mythlike legends recited by our heirs far into the future.

They are all in their fifties. Some of them on their third, fourth or fifth marriage. Their children despise them. They are alcoholics or recovering alcoholics. Drug addicts or recovering drug addicts. Their wrinkled, grey, bald, furrowed and fallen faces look back every morning from the mirror, those folds of dying flesh bearing not a trace of the high, joyful and elastic smiles that once lit them. Their lives have been a ruin and a waste. All that bright promise never quite matured into anything that can be looked back on with pride or pleasure. They took that job in the City, that job with the merchant bank, stockbroker, law firm, accountancy firm, chemical company, drama company, publishing company, any company. The light and energy, the passion, fun and faith were soon snuffed out one by one. In the grind of the demanding world their foolish hopeful dreams evaporated like mist in the cruel glare of the morning sun. Sometimes the dreams return to them at night and they are so ashamed, angry and disappointed that they want to kill themselves. Once they laughed and seduced or laughed and were seduced, on ancient lawns, under ancient stones and now they hate the young and their music, they snort with contempt at everything strange and new and they have to catch their breath at the top of the stairs.

What lay between they called the medii aevi, a medieval period in which time seemed directionless and of less consequence.

Next comes midlife, the great harvest, what Henry Adams referred to as the “Indian Summer of Life … a little sunny and a little sad, like the season.” Thomas Hardy termed midlife “the centre of your time, and not a point at its circumference.” It is Ortega y Gasset's phase of “dominance,” an age for confirming lifestyles, implementing ideas and dreams, realizing projects and plans, mentoring young adults, setting standards for children—and, notes Levinson, “taking the mantle of power.” This is also when individuals realize that the rising generation is no longer their own. Feeling the first signs of physical aging, people realize that they are passing beyond their biological prime. Midlife brings Carl Jung's phase of “individuation,” a time when “man's values, and even his body, do tend to change into their opposites.”

What happens as a Great Event and its echoes fade with the passage of time? In a traditional society, nothing. Absent another Great Event, generations gradually disappear. Twenty-one years afterward, only three distinct generations shaped by the event remain alive. After forty-two years, only two remain; after sixty-three years, only those who were then children can recall it; and after eighty-four years, only a few raspy voices survive to convey personal memories of bygone glories. By then, social inertia will have nudged people of all ages back to the pregenerational life cycle. In countless ancient epics, this is where the falling curtain of time puts an end to the saga.

Generational aging is what translates the rhythm of the past into the rhythm of the future. It explains why each generation is not only shaped by history but also shapes later history. It regulates the velocity of social change. It connects life in its biographical intimacy to history in its social or political grandeur. In all these ways, the generation lies at the root of the saeculum.

In Jung's view, certain symbols, aspirations, and behavioral modes (archetypes) are biologically hard wired into mankind. In all eras and cultures, he said, these archetypes have become so deeply embedded in mankind's “collective unconscious” that no degree of progress, real or imagined, could weaken their grip.

His four archetypal functions draw energy from the dynamic antagonism between two sets of op-posites: thinking versus feeling, sensing versus intuiting. When one function dominates the psyche, its opposite is necessarily suppressed as the psyche's “shadow.” Past midlife, people become conscious of the limits of their dominant archetype and draw energy (constructively or destructively) from its shadow. Jung called this quest for life-cycle self-correction “individuation.”

The 13th Generation (Nomad, born 1961-1981) survived a hurried childhood of divorce, latchkeys, open classrooms, devil-child movies, and a shift from G to R ratings. They came of age curtailing the earlier rise in youth crime and fall in test scores—yet heard themselves denounced as so wild and stupid as to put The Nation at Risk. As young adults, maneuvering through a sexual battlescape of AIDS and blighted courtship rituals, they date and marry cautiously. In jobs, they embrace risk and prefer free agency over loyal corporatism. From grunge to hip-hop, their splintery culture reveals a hardened edge. Politically, they lean toward pragmatism and nonaffiliation and would rather volunteer than vote. Widely criticized as Xers or slackers, they inhabit a Reality Bites economy of declining young-adult living standards.

We may prefer to see ourselves as masters of nature, controllers of all change and progress, exempt from the seasons of history. Yet the more we balk at seasonality and the more we try to eradicate it, the more menacing we render our view of time—and of the future. Most of today's adult Americans grew up in a society whose citizens dreamed of perpetually improving outcomes: better jobs, fatter wallets, stronger government, finer culture, nicer families, smarter kids, all the usual fruits of progress. Today, deep into a Third Turning, these goals often feel like they are slipping away. Many of us wish we could rewind time, but we know we can't—and we fear for our children and grandchildren.

What makes the years between 1946 and 1963 seem so quaint in retrospect is that today we have lost touch with the generational mind-sets of the people who lived through that era. The reclusive Old World Lost elders in dank tenements could not be further from the hip, high-tech Silent in their move-up senior condos. The “high hopes” of midlife G.I.s seem utterly stale, even insensate, to Boomer culture warriors.

Tired of big causes and ideologies, elder Nomads calm society, accept the outcome of the Crisis, and build a functioning civic order out of its glory (or ashes). Believers in functional social rituals, they become old-fashioned elders who place a high priority on protecting children and safeguarding the society's long-term future. They are less impressed than their juniors by swift progress or national triumph, and more fearful of where institutional hubris may lead. Still stigmatized, they strike other generations as burned-out, even reactionary. In old age, the Nomads' reputation for shrewdness never wins them much public reward. They claim little for themselves at a time when the public mood is focused less on rewarding the old than investing in the young.

A High projects its optimism onto children, giving rise to a fertility bulge, a preoccupation with family life, and long investment time horizons. In the orderly post-Crisis world, parents can safely devote more time to child raising and offer new freedoms to a new generation. Nurtured by a well-ordered but spiritually depleted society, children are urged to cultivate strong inner lives. They form stronger bonds with mothers (their links to personal values) than with fathers (their links to civic deeds). Presumed to have a bright future, children are encouraged to demand much of life.

As Donald Knuth famously said, “Premature optimization is the root of all evil.” The key word is premature. Trying to optimize a function before you have tested it is pointless. Trying to optimize an application before you have identified the performance-critical sections is worse than useless. In a just-in-time compiled, self-optimizing runtime such as the JVM, the situation is even more precarious, because it is difficult to look at a piece of code and predict how fast it will run.

Nomad generations have the misfortune to be children in an era when adults are persuading each other to shed social discipline and rediscover their deeper selves. Struggling to cope with the harsh underside of cultural upheaval, Nomad children acquire a cynicism about moral crusades and a fatalism about weak adults apparently unable to make simple things work. They are expected to grow up fast and learn to be independent, resourceful, and competitive at an early age. As they do, however, these qualities earn their fledgling generation a negative reputation among adults. By the end of the Awakening, as adults survey the damage done to the child's world, young Nomads become metaphors of society's newfound pessimism about the future.

At the same time, the genuinely important item – the fake coin, the special card, the hand that conceals a palmed card – is apparently ignored by the deceiver and where possible pushed to the side among clutter, as he knows that if he does not give it status you will probably not think to do so yourself.

On other occasions I find it hard to bring out the best in myself when around people with huge, domineering personalities.

Kindness. If you prefer, compassion. Even benevolence. It is the quality that makes people lovely. If that sounds rather anaemic, it’s because it is the opposite of setting goals and learning how to persuade and close deals; the antithesis of self-reliance and get-what-you-want thinking which form the backbone of modern self-improvement. Its simplicity and obviousness mean that we forget it constantly when we try to impress people, yet it is the most impressive trait we can ever show. It has nothing to do with intelligence or witty banter. We make the mistake of thinking we have to be funny and clever among the ranks of the funny and clever, or match the more obvious qualities of people we would like to like us, when in fact few of us seek out in others those outward aspects of personality we ourselves emanate. In fact, we tend to be sceptical of others with similar noticeable qualities to ourselves. That clever person will not like us more if we appear clever ourselves. He will like us more if we are kind, and lovely, and personable, and not trying to be anything else. In an attempt to be socially striking, and in all the contrived effort we go to in order to make ourselves remarkable, we miss how simple the answer really is. Meanwhile, we all know people who possess those qualities we wish we had more of – intelligence or wit, for example – yet if they are not also lovely, we struggle to really like them.

There are those who are undoubtedly lovely, but lovely to the point of flaccid, vapid futility. They have developed their own wearying addiction to selflessness; cannot themselves receive; feed off the broken; and perhaps even live through a string of abusive relationships as they attract those who exploit them. There are those damaged souls who live out an ostentatious display of masquerading kindness born only from desperate, toxic neediness.

Although one likes to imagine that success brings with it a need for, or even a presumption of, social skills, it is a sad truth that the wealthy tend to be among the least kind of us. Witness the successful executive who charms the bespoke pants off his dinner colleague in a restaurant, but treats the waiter with dismissive contempt. Unfortunately, for those of us who live in a world where a personal assistant and similar luxuries are necessary to function productively, an unfair expectation can arise of how easily life should fall into place, and therefore when it doesn’t, a revolting tendency to blame others for not doing their job properly is a common reaction. A diner having a row with a waiter in a swanky restaurant chills the blood in a way that a quarrel over a pizza order elsewhere would never do. Compassion is rarely the custom of the privileged. How different things would be if that were not the case.

(This kind of busying-oneself activity, frequently employed in lifts when one finds oneself with an unfamiliar travelling companion, is related to the even stranger gestures we must revert to after making the mistake of greeting a friend who is heading towards us from some distance. The level of awkwardness is cruelly and directly in proportion to the length of street that must be covered. After the initial, enthusiastic wave or gesture of recognition has been made and returned, we must then hold eye contact and smile for a second or two longer while we wonder what to do next, before making gestures of open-armed embrace, jumping daftly in the air or miming to amuse the other, until both parties are just about close enough to each other to talk. The alternative to this promenade pantomime involves, after seeing the approaching friend at a distance, feigning apathy with pocket-checks and extended pavement/scenery inspection until the later acknowledgement of his or her existence. This latter operation means that during the awkward period preceding the eventual greeting, one has been in the unusual position of displaying a lack of interest in a loved one, perhaps long missed.)

I decided that much of fussy-eating was a result of expecting not to like something, and presuming that certain tastes were going to be unpleasant. Thus, a process of anticipating the disliked taste, as if awaiting confirmation that the food cannot be enjoyed, maintains the childish, finicky response to food. It is rather like deciding one does not like a particular musical instrument and training one’s ears to pick it up during a symphony; then, the moment it is faintly detected, announcing that the piece is unlistenable. I knew I had to block that process, and that the most effective way to do such a thing would be to fill my mind with the pleasurable noises I might make when eating something I was really enjoying. So, rather than search for the salami taste I knew I did not (historically at least) like, I took a bite and made enthusiastic ‘Mmmm, that is gorgeous’ sounds both out loud and to myself. It worked very well. I actually found myself enjoying the slice of pizza, and with each new slice it took less effort to block my practised reinforcing response of old, so that by the time the pizza was consumed, my loathing of the peppered sausage had passed entirely.

Fun. For them. I am not sure if it was fun for me, in any obvious sense. Yet there is the experience, described by Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi (pronounced ‘cheeks sent me high’), of ‘flow’: a kind of retrospective happiness we can look forward to when we are in our ‘zones’; when our skills match the ongoing challenges of the moment in such a way that we lose ourselves and our sense of time, and experience the kind of focused reverie, the unhindered creative flux, that chess-players achieve when they play chess, surfers feel when they surf, painters when they paint, and magicians, perhaps, experience when they do magic. It is not pleasure that one feels at the time, in fact one may not feel anything easily describable during the experience, but we later record these occasions as our finest and most blissful times.

Holding out a prize at the beginning of a project—and offering it as a contingency—will inevitably focus people’s attention on obtaining the reward rather than on attacking the problem. But introducing the subject of rewards after the job is done is less risky.

Most leaders believed that the people in their organizations fundamentally disliked work and would avoid it if it they could. These faceless minions feared taking responsibility, craved security, and badly needed direction. As a result, “most people must be coerced, controlled, directed, and threatened with punishment to get them to put forth adequate effort toward the achievement of organizational objectives.” But McGregor said there was an alternative view of employees—one that offered a more accurate assessment of the human condition and a more effective starting point for running companies. This perspective held that taking an interest in work is “as natural as play or rest,” that creativity and ingenuity were widely distributed in the population, and that under the proper conditions, people will accept, and even seek, responsibility.

We forget sometimes that “management” does not emanate from nature. It’s not like a tree or a river. It’s like a television or a bicycle. It’s something that humans invented. As the strategy guru Gary Hamel has observed, management is a technology. And like Motivation 2.0, it’s a technology that has grown creaky. While some companies have oiled the gears a bit, and plenty more have paid lip service to the same, at its core management hasn’t changed much in a hundred years. Its central ethic remains control; its chief tools remain extrinsic motivators. That leaves it largely out of sync with the nonroutine, right-brain abilities on which many of the world’s economies now depend. But could its most glaring weakness run deeper? Is management, as it’s currently constituted, out of sync with human nature itself?

Indeed, just consider the very notion of “empowerment.” It presumes that the organization has the power and benevolently ladles some of it into the waiting bowls of grateful employees. But that’s not autonomy. That’s just a slightly more civilized form of control. Or take management’s embrace of “flex time.” Ressler and Thompson call it a “con game,” and they’re right. Flexibility simply widens the fences and occasionally opens the gates. It, too, is little more than control in sheep’s clothing. The words themselves reflect presumptions that run against both the texture of the times and the nature of the human condition. In short, management isn’t the solution; it’s the problem.

Alas, at the heart of private legal practice is perhaps the most autonomy-crushing mechanism imaginable: the billable hour. Most lawyers—and nearly all lawyers in large, prestigious firms—must keep scrupulous track, often in six-minute increments, of their time. If they fail to bill enough hours, their jobs are in jeopardy. As a result, their focus inevitably veers from the output of their work (solving a client’s problem) to its input (piling up as many hours as possible). If the rewards come from time, then time is what firms will get.

This is the world of objects, events, other people and material things. This world was in existence before you were, and will continue after you have gone. But there is another world that exists only because you exist. This is the world of your private consciousness, sensations and feelings.

The essential point is that academic intelligence is often assumed to be of a higher order than all others. Other abilities are assumed to be less important or impressive in themselves. Consequently they are neither sought nor valued to the same extent. The result is that many individuals do not know what they can do, nor who they really are.

There are many misconceptions about creativity. Creativity is not a separate faculty that some people have and others do not. It is a function of intelligence: it takes many forms, it draws from many different capacities and we all have different creative capabilities. Creativity is possible in any activity in which human intelligence is actively engaged.

Brainstorming involves more than being told to have lots of ideas. Generating ideas is essential to the creative process but it isn’t always easy. If it were that simple there would be no need for special techniques in the first place. Spontaneity sometimes has to be carefully planned.

Private imaginings may have no impact in the public world at all. Creativity does. It would be odd to describe someone as creative who just lay still and never did anything. Whatever the task, creativity is not just an internal mental process: it involves action. In a sense, it is applied imagination. To call somebody creative suggests they are actively producing something in a deliberate way.

Human intelligence is not just a process of perception but also of selection. If our minds were on open reception all the time, we couldn’t think or act. There would be too much information coming in, like a radio tuned to an open frequency. Even at the level of primary perception, the mind is exercising choices.56 Our perceptions are guided by our interests, values, attitudes and beliefs. Our perceptions take place within frameworks of conceptions.

Our ability to connect sounds with meanings is what makes language possible. Other animals have only a limited capacity for this. If you say ‘fetch’ to a trained dog, it will sit up and be ready to move. If you were to talk to it about the importance of fetching or great fetchers you’ve known, it will sit blankly until you throw the stick. Show it a picture of the stick and it will probably smell it. Its abilities don’t go far beyond the association of sounds with actions.

Paintings, poems, music and dance are examples of schematic symbols. Their meanings are uniquely expressed in the forms they take. If you want to understand the meaning of a painting you can’t turn to a dictionary of colours to see what blue and green usually mean when they are put together. There is no manual of chords and harmonies that will tell us what a symphony is driving at and no dramatic codebook will tell us what a play means. There are no fixed meanings for the symbolic forms of art, which divide sense from nonsense. The meaning of a work of art is only available in the particular form in which it is expressed.

Schematic forms may use systematic symbols. Plays, novels and poems are after all written in words; and there is musical notation. But the score is not the music, just as the text is not the play. These are the symbols in which the schematic work is encoded and from which it must be translated either in performance or by the reader.

Being creative involves doing something: it takes place in a medium. Real creativity comes from finding your medium, from being in your element. Wynton Marsalis is one of the greatest jazz musicians of our time. If you listen to him playing the trumpet, it’s as if he is speaking to you through it. In a sense, he is. His creativity as a musician is indivisible from his passion for the expressive qualities of the trumpet itself. For him and for us, his power with that instrument is enough. We don’t say, ‘This is all very well but he’s hopeless on the zither.’ The trumpet is his medium.

Creative achievement is related to control of the medium. Simply asking people to be creative is not enough. Children and adults need the means and the skills to be creative. Drawing is a good example. Many adults say they cannot draw. They’re right. They can’t. They’re not incapable of it any more than I am incapable of learning the piano. They just don’t know how.

The problems that many people experience in drawing arise from the interference of the logical/rational processes that tend to dominate our modes of thought. Instead of perceiving the object as it appears, we become focused on drawing it in a photographic way, and find that we can’t. The first problem is perceptual: we have to learn to look at things differently. The second problem is technical, knowing how to create the effects on the page that the eye learns to see.

Creative activity involves playing with ideas and trying out possibilities. But creative achievement does not always require freedom from constraints or a blank page. Great work often comes from working within formal constraints. Some of the finest poetry is in the form of the sonnet, which has a fixed form to which the writer must submit. Japanese haiku similarly makes specific formal demands on the poet, as do many other forms of poetic structure. These do not inhibit the writer’s creativity; they set a framework for it. The creative achievement and the aesthetic pleasure lie in using standard forms to achieve unique effects and original insights.

The main process of art is description. Artists are involved in expressing and describing the qualities of experience. The poet writing of love or melancholy is trying to articulate a state of personal being: a mood or sensibility. Similarly, a composer may try to capture a feeling in music. They are also trying to invoke the sense of feeling in others. Artists are concerned with understanding the world in terms of their own perceptions of it: with expressing feelings, with imagining alternatives and with making objects that express these ideas.

Natural individualism makes completely different assumptions. Every child is thought to be by nature a unique individual. Each child has distinctive, inborn abilities.

The point of education for Read was to improve the quality of human life. At the heart of this was a regard for the individual and for the personal world of imagination and feelings. Material prosperity was no reward for sacrificing these essential human qualities; for quenching emotion and creativity. The idea that society is plotting its own brain death, that human relationships are becoming impoverished and the creative spirit emaciated by advanced technology and commercialism provide fertile conditions for the growth of liberal education with its call for individuality and the purity of childhood.

Public knowledge is a network of ideas and information of which each of us knows only a relatively small amount. We depend for much of our own understanding of the world on the knowledge of other people. We are laced together in networks of knowledge.

For centuries one of the main roles of painters and sculptors was to record the likeness of people, places and events. The invention of photography broke their monopoly. It provided a quick, cheap and faithful method of visual record. The new technology caused agonies of debate - centred on the Royal Academy in London - about the status of this new technology. Many people worried that photography could be the death of painting. Others argued that this was unlikely since a photograph could never be a work of art.

All issues and questions can be considered from an academic point of view and from others too. They can be investigated in the deductive mode or in other modes. Schools and universities teach many subjects but one dominant way of thinking - the verbal, mathematical, deductive and propositional. These processes can be applied to any phenomena: plants, weather, poetry, music, social systems.

He argues that these types of intelligence are more or less independent of each other, and none is more important, though some might be “dominant” while others are “dormant.” He says that we all have different strengths in different intelligences and that education should treat them equally so that all children receive opportunities to develop their individual abilities.

Creativity involves several different processes that wind through each other. The first is generating new ideas, imagining different possibilities, considering alternative options. This might involve playing with some notes on an instrument, making some quick sketches, jotting down some thoughts, or moving objects or yourself around in a space.

In a rapidly changing environment there is little time and energy for training. Employers constantly fear that their best talent will be poached by other companies. This makes them wary of investing in developing their own talent since they fear it will primarily benefit their competitors. Consequently, staff turnover is often high and vacant posts are replenished with outside talent. To win the war for talent, ‘most companies choose to develop more and more powerful recruitment and retention mechanisms to get the “right people” on board and identify the best performers.’ One result is a bonanza for headhunters.

The risk in saying that there is a set number of personality types, a set number of dominant ways of thinking, is that it closes doors rather than opening them. To make the Element available to everyone, we need to acknowledge that each person’s intelligence is distinct from the intelligence of every other person on the planet, that everyone has a unique way of getting in the zone, and a unique way of finding the Element.

There are several problems with this. One is that neither Ms. Briggs nor her daughter, Ms. Myers, had any qualifications in the field of psychometric testing when they designed the test. Another is that test takers often don’t settle neatly into any of the categories when they take the MBTI. They tend to be just a little more to one side of the line or the other (a little more extroverted than introverted, for example), rather than being clearly one thing or the other. Most telling, though, is that many people who repeat the test end up in a different box when they do so. It’s true in at least half of the cases, according to some studies. This suggests either that a huge percentage of the population has serious personality disorder problems, or that the test might not be such a reliable indicator of “type” after all.

Another test is the Hermann Brain Dominance Instrument. I feel a bit more relaxed about this one, because it talks about cognitive preferences in terms that I believe most people would find acceptable. Like the MBTI, the Hermann Brain Dominance Instrument (HBDI) is an assessment tool that uses participants’ answers to a series of questions. It doesn’t seek to put people in a box. Instead, it tries to show people which of four brain quadrants they tend to use more often.

The great philosopher of science Michael Polanyi argues that the free and open exchange of ideas is the vital pulse of scientific inquiry. Scientists like to work on their own ideas and questions, but science is also a collaborative venture. “Scientists, freely making their own choice of problems and pursuing them in the light of their own personal judgment,” he said, “are in fact cooperating as members of a closely knit organization.”

Nobel laureate Richard Feynman spoke of ultra‐miniaturized machines long before anyone had any thought of creating such things. Years later, Marvin Minsky, inspired by Feynman’s idea, became the founding father of artificial intelligence and moved the conversation forward. Then K. Eric Drexler approached Minsky at MIT, and asked the esteemed professor to sponsor his thesis on miniature devices. That thesis served as the foundation for Drexler’s pioneering work in nanotechnology. Through an extended, multigenerational tribe, a concept that critics dismissed as purely science fiction when Feynman introduced it became a reality.

Creative teams are dynamic. Diversity of talents is important, but it is not enough. Different ways of thinking can be an obstacle to creativity. Creative teams find ways of using their differences as strengths, not weaknesses. They have a process through which their strengths are complementary and compensate for each other’s weaknesses too. They are able to challenge each other as equals, and to take criticism as an incentive to raise their game.

Creative teams are distinct. There’s a big difference between a great team and a committee. Most committees do routine work and have members who are theoretically interchangeable with other people. Committee members are usually there to represent specific interests. Often a committee can do its work while half the members are checking their BlackBerrys or studying the wall‐paper. Committees are often immortal; they seem to persist forever, and so often do their meetings. Creative teams have a distinctive personality and come together to do something specific. They are together only for as long as they want to be or have to be to get the job done.

There’s an important difference between leisure and recreation. In a general sense, both words suggest processes of physical or mental regeneration. But they have different connotations. Leisure is generally thought of as the opposite of work. It suggests something effortless and passive. We tend to think of work as something that takes our energy. Leisure is what we do to build it up again. Leisure offers a respite, a passive break from the challenges of the day, a chance to rest and recharge. Recreation carries a more active tone—literally of re‐creating ourselves. It suggests activities that require physical or mental effort but which enhance our energies rather than depleting them.

Consider the preparation we had for the task of management: We were judged to be good management material because we performed well as doers, as technicians and developers. That often involved organizing our resources into modular pieces, such as software routines, circuits, or other units of work.

We managers tend to think of quality as just another attribute of the product, something that may be supplied in varying degrees according to the needs of the marketplace. It’s like the chocolate sauce you pour onto a homemade sundae: more for people who want more, and less for people who want less. The builders’ view of quality, on the other hand, is very different. Since their self-esteem is strongly tied to the quality of the product, they tend to impose quality standards of their own.

During single-minded work time, people are ideally in a state that psychologists call flow. Flow is a condition of deep, nearly meditative involvement. In this state, there is a gentle sense of euphoria, and one is largely unaware of the passage of time: “I began to work. I looked up, and three hours had passed.” There is no consciousness of effort; the work just seems to, well, flow.

Unfortunately, you can’t turn on flow like a switch. It takes a slow descent into the subject, requiring fifteen minutes or more of concentration before the state is locked in. During this immersion period, you are particularly sensitive to noise and interruption. A disruptive environment can make it difficult or impossible to attain flow. Once locked in, the state can be broken by an interruption that is focused on you (your phone, for instance) or by insistent noise (“Attention! Paging Paul Portulaca. Will Paul Portulaca please call extension...” ). Each time you’re interrupted, you require an additional immersion period to get back into flow. During this immersion, you’re not really doing work.

The phenomena of flow and immersion give us a more realistic way to model how time is applied to a development task.

A task accounting scheme that records flow hours instead of body-present hours can give you two huge benefits: First, it focuses your people’s attention on the importance of flow time. If they learn that each work day is expected to afford them at least two or three hours free from interruption, they will take steps to protect those hours. The resultant interrupt-consciousness helps to protect them from casual interruption by peers.

While most of us believed that the trend toward noisier, tighter space was hurting productivity, we kept silent, because we lacked the definitive statistical evidence that proved our case. The Furniture Police, of course, didn’t provide any proof at all to support their contention that people would be just as productive working cheek-by-jowl as they had been in a more sensible environment. They just asserted that it was true.

The person who is working hard to deliver a high-quality product on time is not concerned with office appearances, but the boss sometimes is. So we see the paradoxical phenomenon that totally unworkable space is gussied up expensively and pointlessly with plush carpets, black and chrome furniture, corn plants that get more space than workers, and elaborate panels. The next time someone proudly shows you around a newly designed office, think hard about whether it’s the functionality of the space that is being touted or its appearance. All too often, it’s the appearance.

Appearance is stressed far too much in workplace design. What is more relevant is whether the workplace lets you work or inhibits you. Work-conducive office space is not a status symbol, it’s a necessity. Either you pay for it by shelling out what it costs, or you pay for it in lost productivity.

Many of the everyday tasks performed by professional workers are done in the serial processing center of the left brain. Music will not interfere particularly with this work, since it’s the brain’s holistic right side that digests music. But not all of the work is centered in the left brain. There is that occasional breakthrough that makes you say “Ahah!” and steers you toward an ingenious bypass that may save months or years of work.The creative leap involves right-brain function. If the right brain, is busy listening to 1001 Strings on Muzak, the opportunity for a creative leap is lost.

The creativity penalty exacted by the environment is insidious. Since creativity is a sometime thing anyway, we often don’t notice when there is less of it. People don’t have a quota for creative thoughts. The effect of reduced creativity is cumulative over a long period. The organization is less effective, people grind out the work without a spark of excitement, and the best people leave.

The central volume of the set, A Pattern Language, presents 253 of these patterns and weaves them into a coherent view of architecture. Some of the patterns have to do with light and roominess, others with decor, or with the relationship between interior and exterior space, or with space for adults, for children, for elders, or with traffic movement around and through enclosed space.

Imagine that your organization is about to build a complex of new space. What is the first step in this process? Almost certainly, it is development of a master plan. In most cases, this is a first and fatal deviation from the Timeless Way of Building. Vital, exciting, and harmonious spaces are never developed this way. The master plan envisions hugeness and grandeur, steel and concrete spans, modular approaches and replication to make an enormous whole of identical components. The result is sterile uniformity and space that doesn’t work for anyone except the one Ego to whom it stands as a tribute.

It almost always makes sense to move a project or work group out of corporate space. Work conducted in ad hoc space has got more energy and a higher success rate. People suffer less from noise and interruption and frustration. The quirky nature of their space helps them form a group identity. If you are part of the lofty reaches of upper management, then decide which projects matter most. Move the key ones out.

The insidious effect here is that turnover engenders turnover. People leave quickly, so there’s no use spending money on training. Since the company has invested nothing in the individual, the individual thinks nothing of moving on. New people are not hired for their extraordinary qualities, since replacing extraordinary qualities is too difficult. The feeling that the company sees nothing extraordinary in the worker makes the worker feel unappreciated as an individual. Other people are leaving all the time, so there’s something wrong with you if you’re still here next year.

There is a big difference between Methodology and methodology. Small m methodology is a basic approach one takes to getting a job done. It doesn’t reside in a fat book, but rather inside the heads of the people carrying out the work.

The obsession with Methodologies in the workplace is another instance of the high-tech illusion. It stems from the belief that what really matters is the technology. Even the best imaginable Methodology, one that prescribes exactly the right method for every activity, may give only a small improvement in the technology.

Can’t they use telephones?” The result is that what could be a tightly bound team is scattered over multiple floors or even in different buildings. The specific work interactions may not suffer terribly, but there is no casual interaction. Group members may grow stronger bonds to nongroup neighbors, just because they see more of them.

If you could effect some change in the people you manage and make them much more productive and goal-directed but also less controllable, would you do it? The answer to this question distinguishes the great managers from the merely mediocre. The mediocre manager is too insecure to give up the trappings. The great manager knows that people can’t be controlled in any meaningful sense anyway; the essence of successful management is to get everyone pulling in the same direction and then somehow get them fired up to the point that nothing, not even their manager, could stop their progress.

People crowded agog around the few sets in the village and watched in amazement as naked women bathed in showers using some highly desirable new soap called shampoo, danced on beaches drinking Coca-Cola, or in shockingly short skirts sang the praises of coffee percolators. The old were horrified by such improper images evidently intended to trap the young; the young were horrified to be missing out on all the fun and began to question the traditional ways. Ideas from the other side of the mountain began to infiltrate, which would eventually destroy the way of life of the old Maramureş.

DURING THOSE DAYS one of the ducks went missing, and although we never found her, we did find her nest. In it were eight eggs and we persuaded a broody hen to take them on. Before long the eggs hatched and the hen became the proud mother to eight ducklings, and looked furiously at anyone who dared to come too close. All went well for a few days until, to the hen’s great alarm, all her ‘chicks’ jumped into the stream and started swimming and splashing about happily in the summer sunshine. The hen was thrown into confusion. For days she walked up and down the bank, clucking and fretting and calling to her chicks to see sense and return to dry land.

Western advertising and the new-style television programmes glorifying the modern world, programmes often sponsored by international companies, had been infecting villagers’ minds for several years already. Now the new road allowed this modern world to enter the village, and in it blundered, trampling pitilessly upon the gentle, traditional way of life.

But now the new slick television advertisments had been mesmerizing villagers with images of all sorts of tempting items which they had never needed or wanted before. The advertisements went on, over and over again, ramming the same idea down people’s throats, that they could not possibly live without washing-up liquid or Coca-Cola, or some sort of automatic vegetable slicer. In the end, bludgeoned into submission, people gradually began to buy, and once a few had bought others were obliged to do the same or be considered poor or backward.

An organization attempting to transition to Scrum without support from the top will encounter resistance that cannot be overcome from below. This usually occurs as soon as the new Scrum process begins to affect how areas outside the original team do their work. In response, middle managers protect their departments by striking out against changes created by Scrum. Top-down support will be needed to remove these kinds of impediments and obstacles.

“For the introducer has all those who benefit from the old orders as enemies, and he has lukewarm defenders in all those who might benefit from the new orders.” Notice the equation is unbalanced against change. While you risk making enemies of those who have mastered the old ways–you are forcing them back to the uncomfortable position of novice–you receive only minor support from those who would gain. Why is that? Why are those who stand most to gain from the change still half-hearted in their support? That’s because people hate change. When we start out to change, it is never certain that we will succeed. And the uncertainty is more compelling than the potential for gain.

It’s when you are convinced that you are worse off than before with this new tool, new procedure, or new technique. People are saying things like, “If we just jettison this new stuff, maybe we’ll get back on schedule. . . .” You are suffering from the dip in the learning curve, and the assessment that the change is the problem may well be right, at least for the moment. You are worse off, for now. This is part of the reason why response to change is so emotional. It is frustrating and embarrassing to abandon approaches and methods you have long since mastered, only to become a novice again.

The reason the Satir model is so important is that it alerts us that Chaos is an integral part of change. With the more naive two-stage model, we don’t expect chaos. When it occurs, we mistake it for the new status quo. And since the new status quo seems so chaotic, we think, “Whoops, looks like we blew it; let’s change back.” The change-back message is bound to be heard loud and clear in the middle of any ambitious change. When you’re looking for it, your chances of dealing sensibly with it are much improved.

How many times have you heard that some new technique is going to be used because it is the only chance to make the hard-and-fast deadline, and that if the deadline is missed, there will be hell to pay? The setup of the change has already made its outcome more than a little dubious. The kid-like willingness to throw ourselves into a potentially embarrassing endeavor is defeated by the potential for ridicule. Paradoxically, change only has a chance of succeeding if failure–at least a little bit of failure–is also okay.

The most likely learning center for any sizable organization is the white space that lies between and among middle managers. If this white space becomes a vital channel of communication, if middle managers can act together as the redesigners of the organization, sharing a common stake in the result, then the benefits of learning are likely to be realized. If, on the other hand, the white space is empty of communication and common purpose, learning comes to a standstill. Organizations in which middle managers are isolated, embattled, and fearful are nonstarters in this respect.

In psychological writing, projection is a defence mechanism in which we attribute parts of ourselves to others. These parts are disowned characteristics, often parts of ourselves that we do not like and prefer not to be aware of. The process is unconscious, so we are not aware that the projected characteristic is our own.

Transference is a particular form of projection. It is a pattern of relating to others in the present, influenced by projections resulting from patterns in past relationships. It is a specific misinterpretation of relationship, which through repetition becomes self-fulfilling in the present.

Many individuals, emotionally intelligent in their personal lives, believe that at work they must be completely ‘logical’ and remain emotionally unaffected by their experiences. To be ‘businesslike’ means to be unemotional. This mistaken idea leads people to cut themselves off from huge quantities of useful information about work, and so from crafting creative solutions to dilemmas.

Mirroring52 is everywhere in groups. It does not mean conscious imitation or matching, but refers to non-conscious or unconscious processes. In any situation, we non-consciously compare current encounters and occurrences with previous experiences, in order to make sense of them. Put simply, we are looking for ‘like’ and ‘not like’ (mirroring) and also ‘other than’ (exchange). Because these processes are everywhere, they can be very easy to overlook.

Ethnographic, sociological and psychological studies, including studies of loneliness and severe recidivism, concur: belonging64 is a human need. Being part of something larger which is good is reinternalized as a positive sense of self; members internalize the group atmosphere of acceptance, which augments an internal process of self-acceptance.

Managers, encouraged by their coaches, must become adept in using small shifts to create a climate in which change is likely to occur. The emphasis shifts from power to influence. Every initiative is an experiment, the results of which can be used to refine the next move. All failures, total or partial, provide information.

A sweeping commitment to total confidentiality is a hostage to fortune. If someone tells you a troubling or toxic secret, take up with them immediately the question of how to handle it in the group. Would they be willing to raise it? What would help them do so? Would they be willing for you to raise it? What about first informing the team leader (if s/he is not an actor in the story) or raising it with her/him (if s/he is)? If a team member tells you something important that s/he is not willing to have discussed in the group, consider why. There are sometimes good personal reasons for keeping a secret, but secrets are rarely good for teams. Why has the team member told you if they do not wish the matter aired? So you will feel sympathy, or let them off the hook? To sabotage the process? Because the secret is too troubling to keep? Who else knows this secret? Find out, and consider with the team member the impact, on herself/himself and others, of continuing to keep the secret.

Experience suggests that web- and telephone-based groups work more effectively if they have also met in person. The coach to a virtual team should insist on the necessity of at least one face-to-face encounter, to build a sense of common purpose and mutual relationship, and to begin to tackle communication barriers rooted in cross-cultural misunderstanding.

Silence, like any other group behaviour, is a communication: it means something. People are quiet for many reasons: fear of expressing too much emotion or self-disclosure; fear of self-assertion, or provoking conflict; standards of perfection so exacting that the risk of falling short by speaking is too great; a need for distance or superiority; expressing annoyance (sulking); or, like the dominator, a bid for attention, albeit in a very different style.

‘Yes but’ is a ‘game people play’ recognized by Eric Berne in his classic book.156 Someone playing ‘yes but’ first asks the group for help by presenting a problem, but then rejects any help offered. Her/his problems are insurmountable, and every attempt to help fails. In an extreme form, the group member will be interested only in her/his own problems and will relate to the group only as the one most in need of help.

At times in coaching groups or teams we come across individuals who seem to have a very limited emotional range, and appear unmoved by emotions in circumstances where most people would be. Since, as we have seen in Chapter 2, emotional content is a component of every interaction, such people can find themselves isolated and distant from others. They are unlikely to volunteer for coaching groups, but may be obliged to come, by managers who perceive their need for greater skill at interacting with colleagues. If so, it is helpful to discuss their motivation openly and see if logic can offer some reasons why they should try to engage.

Wilfred Bion defined three ‘basic assumptions’157 that impede a group’s work, founded on his observation of groups. Bion was a visionary whose work is about deeply unconscious processes of which group members will mostly be unaware, but which can at times be observed in group behaviour. The basic assumptions are ways of group members managing repressed anxiety, a flight from reality and the difficulties of being in a group. The three basic assumptions are: • fight/flight • dependency • pairing. Anxiety, fear, hate and love are common to all three group states, but fight/flight is characterized by anger and blame, dependency by guilt and depression, and pairing by unfounded messianic hope. The root of the basic assumptions is an instinctive fear of group disintegration, perhaps surviving from a time when individual survival was only possible through group survival. All three aim to preserve the group at the expense of members’ individual well-being, or the group’s ability to work. They apply in groups of all sizes, but are felt more keenly in larger groups.

The ‘basic assumptions’ • Fight/flight. A group that has gathered together for fight/ flight is a united group – united against a common enemy. Its unity is emotionally satisfying. If the group has no obvious ‘enemy’, then the next best thing is to find a leader to whom the enemy is obvious; if the enemy is ‘within’ the group, it is scapegoating. • Dependency. The assumption in a dependency group is that one person, often the group leader, will supply the needs of the group members; other members are in a position where their needs are to be supplied. There is little mutuality in the arrangement. • Pairing. The group met together for the purposes of ‘pairing off’ provides temporary relief from the trials of the other two basic assumptions, but is no more productive. Sometimes it is expressed through two group members engaging each other in an exclusive conversation, while others watch. Through pairing the survival of the group will be secured. There is a sense of unjustified messianic hope. The basic assumptions are deeply unconscious; group members will not articulate them or be directly aware of them, but they will act as though guided by the currently dominant assumption. The coach can sometimes name the assumption so as to help the group escape its grip.

Conflicts are amplified in the group through the mechanisms described in Chapter 3. The group coach is therefore in a good position to study them: a group conflict will communicate itself to the coach, often through the invitation to play a role or occupy a position rather different to what was written in the contract. The invitation will be not be communicated in words. Here are some roles for which the coach may not have intended to audition: • cheerleader to the apathetic • the enemy • allied with the enemy • behind a soundproof screen • politely ignored • powerless babysitter • the fount of all knowledge • rescuer • persecutor • victim.

When a team has been declared ‘dysfunctional’ or, worse, has come to adopt that view of itself, members’ expectations of coaching are likely to be low. It is helpful to speak individually with all team members to gauge where the levers for change might be. Clear and rigorous goal-setting is important, but the key work will be to clarify the paradoxical or conflicting beliefs and goals as they emerge. Bear in mind that the team may well be carrying ‘dysfunction’ for the larger organization, and so the resistance to changing the label there, may be at least equal to the resistance in the team itself.

Theories-in-use in companies have been found to be remarkably consistent around the world, encapsulated as Model I theory-in-use:159 1 achieve your intended purpose 2 maximize winning and minimize losing 3 suppress negative feelings 4 behave according to what you consider rational. This theory-in-use restricts ‘learning’ to issues that are already discussable, so that underlying defensive routines are not threatened. Discussable problems are identified and solutions generated. These solutions may enjoy limited or initial success, but do not address the underlying problem. Those concerned now have a conflict: if they face the undiscussables, they also have to make public their previous failure or refusal to face them; Model I is then reinforced, as people deny their share of responsibility for the failure.

Most adrenaline junkie organizations enthusiastically embrace the customer service ethic: They confuse responding to urgency with admirable responsiveness. When a customer makes a request, regardless of its potential for profit (or even usefulness), it instantly becomes a project, often with a ridiculously short deadline. (See Pattern 38, “Project Sluts,” for more on this.) This new project naturally increases the workload on the already overloaded heroes, so more busyness comes about—all of it feeding the insatiable need for the organization to be very, very busy.

High morale is an unfailing indicator of organizational health. Similarly, low morale is a sure sign that something is wrong. There is a certain kind of managerial mind that seizes upon this relationship and attempts to exploit it in reverse. The logic goes like this: Force morale up and other good things will follow. Ah, but how to force morale up? In particular, how to do it without investing all the bothersome time and energy and expense necessary to make things truly improve? That’s a tough one, but don’t think people won’t try. Thus the sour humor of the saying, “The beatings will continue until morale improves.”

There is a tendency when forming projects to address the obvious problem—the one that is most manifest and causing the most pain to the client.

The psychologist Daniel Nettle suggests that there are three broad senses of the term happiness.64 The lowest – the basic level – comprises the momentary feelings that make us happy – the joy of sex, the pleasure of a beautiful sunset. The intermediate level is typically a state of mind rather than a physical response, a sense of satisfaction and well-being. These states of mind involve judgements about feelings as distinct from the feelings themselves. Eudaimonia is a high-level concept, a measure of quality of life, of flourishing, of fulfilling one’s potential. Similar distinctions and taxonomies are used by other writers.

An old story tells of a visitor who encounters three stonemasons working on a medieval cathedral, and asks each what he is doing. ‘I am cutting this stone to shape,’ says the first, describing his basic actions. ‘I am building a great cathedral,’ says the second, describing his intermediate goal. ‘And I am working for the glory of God,’ says the third, describing his high-level objective. The construction of architectural masterpieces required that high objectives be pursued through lesser, but nonetheless fulfilling, goals and actions.

To function, we have to break a high-level objective – such as living well – into goals and actions. When Jack Welch lauded obliquity, he went on to point out that the injunction ‘maximise shareholder value’ is not a useful guide to executive action. ‘That’s not a strategy that helps you know what to do when you come to work every day.’

The people who did transform the business world were those, like Google’s Sergey Brin and Apple’s Steve Jobs, who adopted a more oblique approach to business transformation. They invented new businesses rather than re-engineer old ones, they adapted and improvised endlessly, and they carried employees and customers along with them on a wave of enthusiasm.

Brunelleschi just conceived problems differently. His combination of obliquity and linearity is seen, literally and figuratively, in his greatest achievement – the discovery of perspective. He drew things as we see them, rather than as we know they are. That notion now seems obvious, but painters had represented the world differently for thousands of years.

Brunelleschi’s skill lay in his original interpretation of the problem. Such obliquity of approach distinguishes the genius from the merely competent, the creative problem solver from the computer. The computer is very good at solving the problem we have specified and asked it to solve, but less useful when we are not quite sure what the problem is.

In 1959, Charles Lindblom described ‘The Science of “Muddling Through”’. He contrasted two modes of decision making. The root, rational, comprehensive method was direct and involved a single comprehensive evaluation of all options in the light of defined objectives. The oblique approach was characterised by what he called successive limited comparison. Lindblom called the latter ‘the science of muddling through’.

High-level objectives – living a fulfilling life, creating a successful business, producing a distinguished work of art, glorifying God – are almost always too imprecise for us to have any clear idea how to achieve them. That doesn’t imply that these goals lack meaning or the capacity for realisation. We understand their meaning and realise them by translating them into intermediate goals and actions; we interpret and reinterpret them as we gain knowledge about the environment in which we operate. That is why successful approaches are oblique rather than direct.

Those who make distributed teams work best are careful to introduce opportunities for members of the group to get together at least occasionally. Why is face-to-face contact so essential to the success of distributed teams? In the absence of adequate face-to-face contact, teams at one site tend to regard those at the other sites with disdain. “Other sites” often comes to mean “bozos.” Face-to-face contact that is regular, reasonably frequent, and cross-functional builds up the reserves of goodwill and benefit-of-the-doubt that we spend down on all those conference calls and Web meetings.

Central targeting, a technique of planners everywhere, regards such decentralisation as an essentially mechanical problem – agents respond to stimuli as objects react to levers. This method of analysis is often called the principal–agent problem and is sometimes a fruitful way of looking at the world. If you are clear about your objectives and sufficiently knowledgeable about the systems on which their achievement depends, then you can solve problems in this way. But objectives are often vague, complexity extensive, problem descriptions incomplete, the environment uncertain. And, most importantly, responses change the nature of the problem itself.

In tropical waters around the world, cleaner fish remove parasites from the mouths of predators. The large fish attend ‘cleaning stations’, and the smaller fish that congregate there swim into their jaws. Having performed a prophylactic service as they eat their meal, the small fish swim out again unharmed. This phenomenon is hard enough to imagine, let alone invent, and nobody did invent it. What would a management consultant advise the predators to do? A superficial assessment would lead to a recommendation that the predators eat the cleaners. And this conclusion might be right. The more sophisticated consultant would need to define and close the problem – how large a group of predator fish does he represent? Are their goals simply their own hygiene and nutrition? Do the predators have broader objectives: perhaps concerns for their reputation and the marine environment? The consultant would need to assess the available feeding alternatives, for both cleaners and predators. A proper report would need to take account of the subsequent effects on other marine species and the impact on predator welfare. Perhaps you can already envisage the PowerPoint presentation.

One of Klein’s experiments involved showing videos of paramedics in action – some novice, some expert – to various groups of observers. He discovered that both experienced paramedics and lay people were more successful at distinguishing the novices from the professionals than were teachers of paramedic skills.163 Paramedic teachers monitored adherence to the rules they taught and saw such adherence more often in the novices. They looked knowledgeably for directness and could not recognise the success of obliquity from a short video.

Are we better off if we have some control over our anger, our pain, our sense of fairness and unfairness? Certainly. People who get angry all the time find other people unwilling to trade with them, and people who don’t get angry at all get trampled on.

Control over our behaviour is nevertheless important. Anger was once more useful, when we often wanted people in other groups to be frightened of us, than it is today.

A satisfying life depends above all on building good personal relationships with other people, but we miss the point if we seek to develop these relationships with our personal happiness as a primary goal. That is why obliquity is fundamental to our dealings with other people. The reactions of others depend not just on what we do, but on their beliefs about why we do it – and on their perceptions of the kinds of people we are.

It is hard to overstate the damage done in the recent past by people who thought they knew more about the world than they really did. The managers and financiers who destroyed great businesses in the unsuccessful pursuit of shareholder value. The architects and planners who believed that buildings could be designed from first principles, that vibrant cities could be drawn on a blank sheet of paper, and that expressways should be driven through the hearts of communities. The politicians who believed they could improve public services by the imposition of multiple targets. Acknowledging the complexity of the systems for which they were responsible and the multiple needs of the individuals who operated these systems would have avoided these errors.

When faced with a task that daunts you, a project that you find difficult, begin by doing something. Choose a small component that seems potentially relevant to the task. While it seems to make sense to plan everything before you start, mostly you can’t: objectives are not clearly enough defined, the nature of the problem keeps shifting, it is too complex, and you lack sufficient information. The direct approach is simply impossible.

Good decision making is pragmatic and eclectic. Oblique approaches rely on a toolkit of models and narratives rather than any simple or single account. To fit the world into a single model or narrative fails to acknowledge the universality of uncertainty and complexity.

If you are clear about your high-level goals and knowledgeable enough about the systems their achievement depends on, then you can solve problems in a direct way. But goals are often vague, interactions unpredictable, complexity extensive, problem descriptions incomplete, the environment uncertain. That is where obliquity comes into play.

Obliquity is the best approach whenever complex systems evolve in an uncertain environment and whenever the effect of our actions depends on the ways in which others respond to them. There is a role for carrots and sticks, but to rely on carrots and sticks alone is effective only when we employ donkeys and we are sure exactly what we want the donkeys to do. Directness is appropriate when the environment is stable, and objectives are one-dimensional and transparent, and it is then possible to determine when and whether goals have been achieved. And only then.

Our sanitized, corporatized society hasn’t figured out how to get rid of the fear, so instead we channel it into bizarre corners of our life. We check Twitter because of our fear of being left out. We buy expensive handbags for the same reason. We take a mundane follow-the-manual job because of our fear of failing as a map maker, and we make bad financial decisions because of our fear of taking responsibility for our money.

One of my mum’s uncles once had tickets to Arsenal v Spurs at Highbury, and took me when his own son couldn’t make it. We were down among season-ticket holders, the hardest of the hard core football fans who went there for the game, not the violence. Being in a crowd like that is like being caught in the tide – you might try going in the other direction but it drags you along all the same. It was a dull game, style wise, and looked to be heading for a nil – nil draw when suddenly, in injury time, Arsenal made a late surge. As they got into the penalty area I swear the whole stadium, sixty thousand people, held their breath. When the Arsenal forward put it in the back of the net I found myself screaming with joy along with the rest of the people around me. It was entirely involuntary.

The number of story points completed in an iteration is known as the project's velocity. When planning the project, we either used a known velocity (if we had one, perhaps from another similar project) or we made one up. Velocity can be a useful management tool, so it is important to look at the team's velocity at the end of each iteration as well as during the iterations.

Scrum projects progress through a series of thirty-day iterations called sprints. At the start of each sprint the team determines the amount of work it can accomplish during that sprint. Work is selected from a prioritized list called the product backlog. The work the team believes it can complete during the sprint is moved onto a list called the sprint backlog. A brief daily meeting, the daily scrum, is held to allow the team to inspect its progress and to adapt as necessary.

Taking on more than you can handle at maximum speed is a recipe for getting slow. You almost never see the quantity/speed trade-off stated quite this bluntly—it’s downright unappealing.

Thoughtful task definition establishes a wide lane within which the assigned team member may operate freely. However, it is almost impossible to specify exactly everything that needs to be done as part of the assignment. We think of project assignments as creating three zones of authorization: The green zone consists of the things that are explicitly a part of the assignment: the core of the work to be done. The red zone includes anything that is explicitly excluded from the scope of the assignment. The blue zone is everything else: activities that are neither required nor prohibited by the assignment. In other words, everything that lies between the green and red zones.

Project managers know that they have to understand the true state of their projects and to report accurately on them. Sometimes, however, they lose sight of the reason for all this attention to detail: to make sure the project achieves its objectives. They adopt as their goal the accurate portrayal of the state of the project at all times. They become, in effect, journalists. Like film critics,[1] project journalists believe—if only subconsciously—that they can succeed even if their project fails.

But this kind of safety does not come from benevolent management or well-meaning team leaders. It comes from within: The team members know that argument is not personal, that it is not to establish a pecking order or to showcase a tiresome display of personal knowledge.

It starts innocently. One of the marketing staff has a request from a customer to add an extra pull-down menu. Then a requirement arrives to add an export interface to the product, the product manager wants to include a new analysis report, and the DBA asks for another new field in the database and to change the color of the background. All of these requirements, and many more, are passed to the developers for inclusion in the product. The features of the product grow with each addition, but after a while, everyone—marketing, customers, and development—loses sight of how all these pieces fit together and how they help achieve the business goals. The project that once set out with the intention of meeting a specific purpose has instead become an indigestible soup of unconnected features.

Organizations that stay out of the soup share a number of characteristics: Project goals and non-goals are defined as crisply and as early as possible. Project scope is declared and kept up-to-date against a precise definition of input and output data (see Pattern 24, “The White Line”). Iron will is exercised in rejecting requirements that do not advance stated goals and fall demonstrably outside the project scope. New requirements follow an approved, traceable change-control process during which they are evaluated against the stated goals of the project. Avoiding feature soup takes discipline. And it pays to keep in mind that it is you, the project team—not the requestors of piecemeal features— that will be in the soup.

The result of this misdirected civility is deep mediocrity. Serious improvement is highly unlikely, and any kind of complete restart or rewrite is just about impossible. No one is ever going to say, “Let’s trash this code and rethink the whole front end,” even when it’s the best thing to do. The source of false good manners is a clear, but never publicly stated, message from somewhere on-high in the organization. It is a form of cowardice that is disguised as politeness.

Workers who are assigned to multiple, concurrent projects cannot maintain the top brainpower production rate because there is a price, in brainpower units, to pay for multitasking. Switching from the context of project A to project B requires some brainpower for understanding the project B status. Finding all the right project B files, clearing project A thoughts from the mind, reestablishing contact with project B people, and rehashing thoughts that were previously settled—these steps are all necessary for the brain to get reoriented into the context of project B.

The next time you hear someone in your organization refer to a failure to communicate, look underneath for the subtitle. It’s likely to read, “I understand you clearly, but I hate what you’re saying.” Calling this a communication failure turns everyone’s attention away from the real cause—legitimate conflict—and focuses attention instead on a false cause. The result is a more-and-more elaborate effort to communicate a message that is being flat-out rejected.

In 1996, an engineering manager revived the old idea of creating an Engineering Book of Knowledge (EBoK), a database that would capture the relevant knowledge that engineers needed to do their job, including compliance standards, best practices, lessons learned, and supplier specifications. The EBoK vision could succeed only if the engineers themselves took responsibility for creating and maintaining the content. Some Tech Club leaders saw the project as an opportunity for consolidating Tech Club knowledge and taking stewardship of it. Documenting engineering knowledge had been tried several times before, but now it was part of the activities and identity of specific communities in charge of designated areas of engineering. This communal responsibility for producing the EBoK was key to its success.

Here are a few practical guidelines if you hope to become a quick-witted fast-talking 90-year-old cribbage shark: You are what you do. The brain is constantly rewiring the connections between your neurons, strengthening the ones you use and weakening the ones that you don't. In other words, when you spend a day munching Cheetos, watching American Idol reruns, and lamenting the tragedy of your life, you aren't just whiling away the time. You're also training your brain to be a better Cheetos-eater, TV watcher, and chronic worrier. Fall into this pattern for a few years, and your brain just won't look the same. Use it or lose it. The brain may not be a muscle, but there's good evidence that the human body doesn't waste effort maintaining mental hardware that you never use. Surprisingly, it seems that it's never too late to ramp up your thinking. Many studies suggest that suddenly giving your brain more to do, even late in life, can overcome recent brain decline and foster broad, long-term improvements.

Alcohol can help you get to sleep, but it wreaks havoc with the sleep cycles you'll learn about later in this chapter, ultimately leading to a less restful night. If you do indulge in a late-night tipple, stay awake afterwards to give your body enough time to metabolize the alcohol (and down a few glasses of water to stave off late-night dehydration).

People who miss sleep for several days begin to experience microsleep, a phenomenon where the brain shuts off for a few seconds at a time. This can cause the microsleeper to lose track of a conversation, a multistep task, or a heavy piece of machinery, sometimes with dangerous consequences. Microsleepers are usually unaware of what's happening—if it happens to you, you'll probably notice little more than a vague feeling of zoning out. The best antidote is a decent sleep—soon.

The best way to tell if you're seriously sleep-deprived is by gauging your sleepiness during the day. However, when faced with a tedious task, it's sometimes difficult to determine whether poor slumber or blinding boredom is causing your yawns. In this case, look for other symptoms of the sleep-starved, such as falling asleep at the end of the day in one minute flat. (An average well rested person takes about 15 minutes to nod off.)

The best time to wake up is at the beginning of a sleep cycle, while you're still in stage 1 or stage 2 sleep. If you're getting the recommended 8 hours of sleep, you'll find it easy to wake up between sleep cycles. At this point, sleep is at its lightest, and minor stimulus—a birdsong, a sunrise, a bulging bladder—can nudge you into full wakefulness. By comparison, if you aren't allowing yourself enough time to sleep and you're using an alarm clock to start the day, you may find yourself shocked out of stage 3 or stage 4 sleep. In that case, you're apt to feel like you've fallen under a cement truck.

Virtually all mammals experience REM sleep. However, REM sleep is a risky time, because it renders animals paralyzed and helpless. To make matters worse, during REM sleep the body consumes nearly as much energy as when it's awake, which is a marked contrast to the other, thriftier stages of sleep. This suggests that REM has some fundamental importance, or a superior race of non-dreamers would have evolved millions of years ago.

THIS EXPERIMENT TAUGHT us that sucking the meaning out of work is surprisingly easy. If you’re a manager who really wants to demotivate your employees, destroy their work in front of their eyes. Or, if you want to be a little subtler about it, just ignore them and their efforts. On the other hand, if you want to motivate people working with you and for you, it would be useful to pay attention to them, their effort, and the fruits of their labor.

Why did the nice people at MIT and SAP design the system this way? Why did they break tasks into so many components, put each person in charge of only small parts, and never show them the overall progress or completion of their tasks? I suspect it all has to do with the ideas of efficiency brought to us by Adam Smith.

Do you encounter more rudeness, ignorance, nonchalance, and sometimes hostility in stores, on flights, at car rental counters, and so on than ever before? I am not sure who started this chicken-and-egg problem, but as we consumers encounter offensive service, we become angrier and tend to take it out on the next service provider—whether or not he or she is responsible for our bad experience. The people receiving our emotional outbursts then go on to serve other customers, but because they are in a worse mood themselves, they aren’t in a position to be courteous and polite.

Let’s look at the biases that affected me. First, it was difficult for me to accept the doctors’ recommendation because of two related psychological forces we call the endowment effect and loss aversion. Under the influence of these biases, we commonly overvalue what we have and we consider giving it up to be a loss. Losses are psychologically painful, and, accordingly, we need a lot of extra motivation to be willing to give something up. The endowment effect made me overvalue my arm, because it was mine and I was attached to it, while loss aversion made it difficult for me to give it up, even when doing so might have made sense.

For hundreds of years, leeches were used for bloodletting—a procedure that, it was believed, helped rebalance the four humors (blood, phlegm, black bile, and yellow bile). Accordingly, the application of bloodsucking, sluglike creatures was thought to cure everything from headaches to obesity, from hemorrhoids to laryngitis, from eye disorders to mental illness. By the nineteenth century, the leech trade was booming; during the Napoleonic Wars, France imported millions upon millions of the critters. In fact, the demand for the medicinal leech was so high that the animal nearly became extinct.

Wouldn’t it be nice if we realized that, despite all our confidence and faith in our own judgments, our intuitions are just intuitions? That we need to collect more empirical data about how people actually behave if we want to improve our public policies and institutions? It seems to me that before spending billions on programs of unknown efficacy, it would be much smarter to run a few small experiments first and, if we have the time, maybe a few large ones as well. As Sherlock Holmes noted, “It is a capital mistake to theorize before one has data.”

Many people find that full-fledged journals are just too much of a chore to keep up. However, you can create similar anchoring points without recording the full detail of a journal entry. One good example is a themed list, such as funny things said by your preschooler, tasty meals at restaurants, recently read books, and so on.

Usually, your brain will be forced to reimagine some of the experience, but it will also be able to remember some legitimate details that actually did happen and aren't recorded in the memory aid. This phenomenon suggests the somewhat frustrating fact that your brain has vast oceans of memory locked away, many of which you'll never glimpse again unless you have the right memory aid to unlock them.

Twenty-three chromosomes doesn't sound like a lot, but it holds the potential for a great many different babies. When creating an egg or sperm cell, your body randomly chooses to send along one of two possible chromosomes from each of your chromosome pairs. In total, there are 23 such decisions, which means you have the ability to make 223 genetically different eggs or sperms (about eight million varieties). Team up with a willing partner, and you can combine your chromosomes in 246 genetically different ways. That makes for a mind-boggling 70 trillion possible versions of you.

You may have heard the myth that every embryo begins as a female. In reality, we begin with all the plumbing we need to go either way. Technically, a six-week old embryo is sexually undifferentiated. It contains basic anatomy that can be converted to male testicles or female ovaries, depending on the influence of the all-important SRY gene.

A perfect example of this bias are color associations—the unwritten rules that make pink feminine and blue masculine. Although we accept these associations (even when we deliberately rebel against them), they're actually a relatively recent invention. In the 1920s, when Western parents began to dress their children in color, pink was preferred for boys. It was seen as a watered down version of red, and red was considered to be both masculine and fierce. Pale blue was used for girls and considered to be a far daintier color, possibly because of its association with the Virgin Mary. Somewhere in the 1940s, these preferences flip-flopped to the modern standards, where they've remained ever since.

The distinction between these two graphs shapes how we understand sex differences. It's particularly important because when we discover differences between sexes, they all too easily become part of our definition of what it means to be a man or a woman. For example, if a researcher finds that men excel at math (in other words, have a slightly higher overall average), it becomes easy for teenage girls to give up on the subject and parents to excuse poor performance.

Several more recent studies have looked at the brain activity of new lovers as they gaze at a picture of their beloved. These studies find that the brain's reward system (namely, the nucleus accumbens that you learned about on Pleasure: The Reward System) lights up like a fairground when it recognizes its loved one.

Researchers find that even in the initial stages of a romance, it's surprisingly easy to predict which relationships will last. One of the best tests is to watch a couple argue. Couples who last have a much more effective negotiating style, and the ratio of positive to negative statements during a conflict conversation is five to one. Relationships with grimmer prospects have more negativity, and a positive-to-negative ratio that's closer to one to one.

If leverage sounds too good to be true, it is, because it works in both directions. In the late 1980s, many young professionals in London were desperate to find a place on the housing ladder. They might have bought a £100,000 flat with a loan of £95,000. Their finances went spinning out of control when interest rates rose and house prices fell. If their flat would realise only £85,000, their savings of £5000 had become a debit of £10,000.

Enter intermediation, a process in which banks borrowed and lent, not just to and from their customers, but to and from each other. Banks began to securitise. They would take packages of loans and parcel them into bonds of shorter or longer maturity. There were fees to be earned by issuing and trading in these packages. As bonds became exciting, from the 1980s, the pace of securitisation accelerated.

Managers given a target of finding 5% or 10% cost savings, a frequent corporate practice, can usually deliver. Sometimes this can be done with little effect on the efficiency of the business or the quality of its product. We have all encountered people who reduce, rather than increase, the effectiveness of the organisation that employs them. You can always spend less on maintenance, or on customer service, or press employees to work harder. These actions will have consequences for future profits, but the consequences will be some time ahead, and may prove to be more or less expensive than the initial cost savings.

Aichaku (ahy-chaw-koo) is the Japanese term for the  sense of attachment one can feel for an artifact. When written  by its two kanji characters, you can see that the first character  means "love" and the second one means "fit."

A simple response can fight confusion and delays. Straightforwardness undermines character assassination. Respect prompts, in return, respect for you and your idea. A constant eye on the audience whose support you need keeps you from making the dangerous mistake of focusing only on the aggravating disruptors. Preparation helps you anticipate how people might totally confuse the conversation, kill your idea through delay, raise too many anxieties, or effectively ridicule you and other supporters so that your credibility, and message, die.

Some verbal bullets don’t shoot directly at the idea but at the people behind the idea. The proposers may be made to look silly. Questions may be raised about competence. Slyly or directly, questions can be raised about character. Strong buy-in is rarely achieved if an audience feels uneasy with those presenting a proposal.

Inhibited by its highly evolved brain from living an unselfconscious life entirely dominated by instinct, humanity had to hammer out a painful compromise with itself, whereby it traded the full blaze of instinctive expression for the gentle warmth of social good. This compromise is usually described as ‘civilisation’, and it is always precarious, because the uneasy bargain on which it is based is not one that all are able to make.

But torture never vanished from the earth, and it has made a dramatic reappearance in our own day. What is hard to acknowledge is that, in the right circumstances, most of us are capable of taking part in it. This was established by the famous obedience experiment conducted by the social psychologist Stanley Milgram in 1963, in which people were encouraged to ‘electrocute’ peers as punishment for a mistake. Milgram established the experiment because he wanted to understand how so many ‘good’ Germans became involved in the murder of millions of Jews.

And then, in the 1980s, the holy grail was found. It was called the principle of shareholder value maximization. It was argued that professional managers should be rewarded according to the amount they can give to shareholders. In order to achieve this, it was argued, first profits need to be maximized by ruthlessly cutting costs – wage bills, investments, inventories, middle-level managers, and so on. Second, the highest possible share of these profits needs to be distributed to the shareholders – through dividends and share buybacks. In order to encourage managers to behave in this way, the proportion of their compensation packages that stock options account for needs to be increased, so that they identify more with the interests of the shareholders.

The worst thing about shareholder value maximization is that it does not even do the company itself much good. The easiest way for a company to maximize profit is to reduce expenditure, as increasing revenues is more difficult – by cutting the wage bill through job cuts and by reducing capital expenditure by minimizing investment.

Generating higher profit, however, is only the beginning of shareholder value maximization. The maximum proportion of the profit thus generated needs to be given to the shareholders in the form of higher dividends. Or the company uses part of the profits to buy back its own shares, thereby keeping the share prices up and thus indirectly redistributing even more profits to the shareholders (who can realize higher capital gains should they decide to sell some of their shares).

Cutting jobs may increase productivity in the short run, but may have negative long-term consequences. Having fewer workers means increased work intensity, which makes workers tired and more prone to mistakes, lowering product quality and thus a company’s reputation. More importantly, the heightened insecurity, coming from the constant threat of job cuts, discourages workers from investing in acquiring company-specific skills, eroding the company’s productive potential.

Higher dividends and greater own-share buybacks reduce retained profits, which are the main sources of corporate investment in the US and other rich capitalist countries, and thus reduce investment.

Since the summer of 1922, inflation in Germany had been getting out of control. The cost of living index rose by sixteen times in six months in the second half of 1922. Of course, the hyperinflation was at least in part caused by the onerous reparation demands by the French and the Belgians, but once it started, it was entirely rational for the French and the Belgians to occupy the Ruhr in order to make sure that they were paid their war reparations in goods, such as coal and steel, rather than in worthless paper, whose value would diminish rapidly.

As for the idea that developing countries can largely skip industrialization and enter the post-industrial phase directly, it is a fantasy. Their limited scope for productivity growth makes services a poor engine of growth. The low tradability of services means that a more service-based economy will have a lower ability to export. Lower export earnings means a weaker ability to buy advanced technologies from abroad, which in turn leads to a slower growth.

A small, but not negligible, part of de-industrialization is due to optical illusions, in the sense that it reflects changes in statistical classification rather than changes in real activities. One such illusion is due to the outsourcing of some activities that are really services in their physical nature but used to be provided in-house by manufacturing firms and thus classified as manufacturing output (e.g., catering, cleaning, technical supports). When they are outsourced, recorded service outputs increase without a real increase in service activities.

In manufacturing, where mechanization and the use of chemical processes are much easier, it is easier to raise productivity than in services. In contrast, by their very nature, many service activities are inherently impervious to productivity increase without diluting the quality of the product.

A lot of the increases in retail service productivity in countries such as the US and Britain has been bought by lowering the quality of the retail service itself while ostensibly offering cheaper shoes, sofas and apples: there are fewer sales assistants at shoe stores, so you wait twenty minutes instead of five; you have to wait four weeks, rather than two, for the delivery of your new sofa and probably also have to take a day off work because they will only deliver ‘sometime between 8 a.m. and 6 p.m.’; you spend much more time than before driving to the new supermarket and walking through the now longer aisles when you get there, because those apples are cheaper than in the old supermarket only because the new supermarket is in the middle of nowhere and thus can have more floor space.

De-industrialization also has a negative effect on a country’s balance of payments because services are inherently more difficult to export than manufactured goods. A balance of payments deficit means that the country cannot ‘pay its way’ in the world. Of course, a country can plug the hole through foreign borrowing for a while, but eventually it will have to lower the value of its currency, thereby reducing its ability to import and thus its living standard.

Why are there such huge differences between the things that you can buy in different countries with what should be the same sums of money? Such differences exist basically because market exchange rates are largely determined by the supply and demand for internationally traded goods and services (although in the short run currency speculation can influence market exchange rates), while what a sum of money can buy in a particular country is determined by the prices of all goods and services, and not just those that are internationally traded.

In short, since the 1980s, we have given the rich a bigger slice of our pie in the belief that they would create more wealth, making the pie bigger than otherwise possible in the long run. The rich got the bigger slice of the pie all right, but they have actually reduced the pace at which the pie is growing. The problem is that concentrating income in the hands of the supposed investor, be it the capitalist class or Stalin’s central planning authority, does not lead to higher growth if the investor fails to invest more.

One temptation of recruiters is to try and  add a few extra hoops to the application  process. I've frequently heard the suggestion of  including a programming quiz of some sort in  the application procedure. This does work, in  the sense that it reduces the number of applications   you get, but it doesn't work, in the sense  that it doesn't really improve the quality. Great  developers have enough choices of places to  work that only require the usual cover  letter/resume application to get started; by  inventing artificial hoops and programming  tests and whatnot simply to apply, you're just as

Marshall Langer, a prominent supporter of secrecy jurisdictions, neatly outlines the gulf between perceptions and the reality. ‘It does not surprise anyone when I tell them that the most important tax haven in the world is an island,’ he said. ‘They are surprised, however, when I tell them that the name of the island is Manhattan. Moreover, the second most-important tax haven in the world is located on an island. It is a city called London in the United Kingdom.’

In the popular imagination, the best way to achieve secrecy in your financial affairs is to shift your money to Switzerland or Liechtenstein, say, cloaked under strong bank secrecy laws. Now, bank secrecy is not to be sniffed at, but what most people do not realise is that trusts are, in a sense, the Anglo-Saxon equivalent. Not only that, but trusts potentially create forms of secrecy that are more difficult to penetrate than the straightforward reticence of the Swiss variety.

The apology cannot, of course, erase what was done, but it has the potential to transform the situation created by the offence.

The American phenomenon of ‘going postal’ has been linked to precisely the same problem: if you tell every child that they can grow up to become president, you aren’t necessarily doing them a favour. For while the self-belief you might foster can only be a good thing, the moment when reality crashes in and makes it clear that only the very talented or the very rich have a hope of a successful political career is a painful one.

Sparta also had a celebrated lawgiver, named Lycurgus, who conducted a several-pronged attack on wealth, seeing it as an evil that made Spartans soft, and prone to crime. He eliminated gold and silver coinage, and made iron the only valid currency, assigning a low value to it, so that Spartans needed a vast amount to buy anything. And as Plutarch observes, ‘Once this was made legal tender, many types of crime disappeared from Sparta. For who would set out to steal, or accept as a bribe, or rob, or plunder something which could not be hidden, excited no envy when possessed, and could not even profitably be chopped up?’

Implicit learning is defined as learning without effort or awareness of  exactly what has been learned. Perhaps the best example is a child's ability   to master her native language. Children do not spend hours studying  vocabulary lists and attending classes on grammar and syntax.

In many hackneyed works of science fiction, human emotions are  treated as excess baggage that get in the way of efficient decisionmaking.  Invariably there is an android that is a much better thinker and decision-maker   than its human counterparts, because it has no emotions to muck  up things. By the end of the story, we come to realize that we would never  trade our lives for the android's. Even though emotions cause us to act  irrationally and to make bad decisions, we are willing to sacrifice precision   and accuracy for the richness of love, passion, and art. Who would  want to live the stark, emotionless life of an android?

A number of psychologists have argued that the job of the adaptive  unconscious is to detect patterns in the environment as quickly as possible   and to signal the person as to whether they are good or bad. Such a  system has obvious advantages, but it also comes with a cost: the quicker  the analysis, the more error-prone it is likely to be. It would be advantageous   to have another, slower system that can provide a more detailed  analysis of the environment, catching errors made by the initial, quick  analysis. This is the job of conscious processing.

These results suggest that when people  think about it carefully, they can apply the discounting principle, deducing   that they must like an activity less if they were rewarded for doing it.  If they are not thinking carefully about it, however, their conscious system   fails to apply the discounting principle (which, after all, was learned  rather late in development)-even though the adaptive unconscious  already has."

The adaptive unconscious   is an older system designed to scan the environment quickly and  detect patterns, especially ones that might pose a danger to the organism.   It learns patterns easily but does not unlearn them very well; it is a  fairly rigid, inflexible inferencemaker. It develops early and continues to  guide behavior into adulthood.

Further evidence for the nonconscious influence of past relationships  comes from research on attachment relationships. Initially this work  focused on the internal working models of attachment that infants  formed about their parents, which are measured by observing how an  infant interacts with his or her parent and a stranger in a laboratory setting   (in a procedure known as the Strange Situation). The parent is asked  to leave the room and then return several times, and the infant's reactions   to these separations and reunions are observed. On the basis of  these reactions, the infant is classified as having a secure, avoidant, or  anxious/ambivalent working model of attachment.

Cicero used rhetorical flourishes like an Old Master wielded a paintbrush: his speeches are full of techniques that we recognise in those of politicians or lawyers today. He loved to use apophasis, an allusion to something by promising not to talk about it. ‘Quod ego praetermitto et facile patior sileri’ – ‘I make no mention of this, and readily allow it to be passed over in silence’ – he says, of the unproven accusation that Catiline had killed both his wife and child. And just to be sure you noticed, he says he won’t mention it twice.

Cicero used every trick in the book to win his cases: repetition, hyperbole and litotes (deliberate understatement for extra effect). A terrific example of this in modern culture is the character of Patrick Nice, played by Mark Williams in The Fast Show, who is persistently underwhelmed by his good fortune: ‘And I was rummaging round in the attic, and I found the original copy of the Bible, signed by God.

Pre-socratic philosophy was a mixture of what we might now call philosophy with natural science. Then Socrates began to ask the questions that shaped Western thought for two and a half millennia, about truth, goodness and beauty. There can be few individuals who have had such a considerable, and lasting, effect on human thought, without writing a single word.

Societies have often sought to quash their revolutionaries by accusing them of corrupting the young, especially when the society itself is in danger. And in 399 BCE, when Socrates died, Athens was certainly weak. She had finally lost the debilitating war with the Spartans in 404 BCE. The democracy had been overthrown, temporarily, and replaced with a murderous oligarchy known as the Thirty Tyrants.

This is the Socratic paradox that comes up many times in Plato’s writing. No one is wise, because none of us knows anything. But Socrates knows that he doesn’t know a thing, which makes him wiser than the rest of us. It seems like a fallacy – how can he literally know nothing when he knows one thing, namely his ignorance?

One point to note, though, is that Socrates’ obsession with definition may be tiresome, but it may also be more important now than ever. We live in a time when language is tortured beyond sense. Who hasn’t received a letter from their bank telling them that for their convenience, the bank will now open later on Wednesdays to provide staff training?

There are two solutions to the theory problem, one old and one new.  The old solution is psychoanalytic theory, which argues that the reason  feelings can be unconscious is repression. The newer solution is our  friend the adaptive unconscious, which might produce feelings independently   of people's conscious constructions of their feelings.

Over a century ago, William Carpenter  argued for the existence of such "unnoticed" feelings, such as "the growing   up of a powerful attachment between individuals of opposite sexes,  without either being aware of the fact." Carpenter noted that "The existence   of a mutual attachment, indeed, is often recognised by a bystander   ... before either of the parties has made the discovery ... the  Cerebral state manifests itself in action, although no distinct consciousness   of that state has been attained, chiefly because, the whole attention  being attracted by the present enjoyment, there is little disposition to  introspection."0

Further, people differ in the frequency with which they recognize their  own feelings; indeed, one definition of emotional intelligence is the ability   to recognize our wants, needs, joys, and sorrows.

Other people are less skilled at this kind of self-awareness."

Another cause of the durability bias is that people fail to take into  account the ways in which their external worlds will change after an  emotional event. One version of this error is misunderstanding the  nature of the event itself. When people imagine what it would be like to  win a million dollars, they think about vacations to exotic places and  new cars. If they understood that winning the lottery would also entail  family feuds, lost friendships, and harassing phone calls in the middle of  the night, they would make more accurate predictions about how they  would feel. Psychologists refer to this as the misconstrual problem: people  make inaccurate predictions about their reactions to emotional events  because they are thinking about the event in the wrong way.23

Why people overestimate the duration of their emotional reactions to  future events is now clear. First, they fail to take into account the extent  to which external events will influence their thoughts and feelings (the  focalism bias). Perhaps more importantly, they also fail to anticipate  how quickly novel events will come to seem mundane through the psychological   process of ordinization. This is especially difficult to do  because at the time people make their predictions, the event is novel and  powerful.

Instead of a complex questionnaire, in this model the customer is asked a single question: ‘Who recommended this product to you, and who would you recommend it to?’

Beware! We often defer decisions because we have doubts. But not making a decision is a decision in itself. If you delay a resolution it is often an unconscious decision, one that you do not communicate. This leads to uncertainty in a team. So if you want to make a decision later, be sure to communicate this clearly.

But why do we find it so difficult to recognise our mistakes? Why do we even go as far as defending our actions when we are confronted with their shortcomings? Rather than asking for forgiveness, we embark on one of the more unlikeable human attributes: self-justification. This acts as a protective mechanism that enables us to sleep at night and frees us from self-doubt. We see only what we want to see, and ignore everything that contradicts our view. We look for arguments that reinforce our position.

Long-term memory has two components: retrievability and stability. Retrievability determines how easily we remember something, and depends on how near the surface of our consciousness the information is ‘swimming’. Stability, on the other hand, is to do with how deeply information is anchored in our brains. Some memories have a high level of stability but a low level of retrievability.

The problem inherent in the double loop is the discrepancy between what we say we are about to do (known as espoused theory) and what we actually do (known as theory in use). If we really want to change something, it is not enough to create guidelines for our employees or ourselves, or to give directives. These only reach us as a command (espoused theory). Real changes occur when we reassess our more deeply rooted reasons, objectives and values. These are the ‘force fields’ that affect the theory in use.

This team model will help you to judge your team. Begin by defining the skills, expertise and resources that you think are important for carrying out the project. Note the skills that are absolutely necessary for the job. Distinguish between soft skills (e.g. loyalty, motivation, reliability) and hard skills (e.g. computer, business and foreign-language abilities). For each skill, define where your critical boundary lies on a scale of zero to ten. For example, an acceptable level of fluency in French might be five. Now judge your ‘players’ according to these criteria. Connect the points with a line. What are the team’s weaknesses, and what are their strengths?

If we can be made to feel dissatisfied with what we have, we will spend our money on something new. So each new car, laptop or mobile phone has to be shinier, sleeker, slimmer. Suddenly, the old phone looks like a brick, the old computer (which was once the fastest thing on any desk) now seems sluggish and tired, the old car seems lumpy and insufficiently aerodynamic.

Plato had none of Socrates’ issues with calling himself an educator. In the mid 380s BCE he set up a school, of sorts, in an olive grove in Athens, called Akademia. Plato’s Academy didn’t charge fees, but it was an organised location where men could come to exchange ideas and arguments. It lasted for hundreds of years, and produced countless other intellectuals, of whom the most famous is Aristotle.

We all know what a cynic is, and it isn’t someone who denies himself a stiff gin and an iced bun. It’s someone who expects the worst, has little faith in his fellow man and sees self-interest everywhere. But a Cynic was once someone who eschewed worldly pleasures like money, power and influence, and lived a life of simple purity, eating little and sleeping outdoors. ‘Cynic’ in Greek means ‘doglike’, and it’s easy to see how the connection could be made in a time when dogs slept outdoors and didn’t fit into a handbag.

Like the word ‘cynic’, ‘epicurean’ has acquired a totally different meaning from its original one. Epicurus believed that the virtuous life was one of pleasure. But his embracing of hedonism has led to the mistaken conviction that he was a gourmet and a gourmand, in thrall to the sensual pleasures of excessive eating and drinking. Actually, he was neither. The Epicurean ideal was a life of ataraxia – tranquillity. For that to be achieved, a person needed to be free from pain. And for Epicurus, freedom from pain was the same thing as pleasure.

The virtuous Stoic needed to have the four primary virtues: prudence, moderation, justice and courage. In addition to these, according to Stobaeus, a fifth-century ce compiler of extracts from Greek authors, were secondary virtues of lesser importance: good sense, good calculation, quick-wittedness, discretion, resourcefulness, good discipline, seemliness, modesty, self-control, endurance, confidence, high-mindedness, cheerfulness, industriousness, piety, honesty, equity and fair dealing.

Stoic determinism is certainly not a very appealing doctrine: most of us choose to believe that we have at least some control over the lives we lead, or how can we have any notion of moral responsibility at all? Diogenes Laërtius sums the whole thing up: ‘The story goes that Zeno was flogging a slave for stealing. “I was fated to steal,” said the slave. “And to be flogged,” was Zeno’s reply.’

Self-justification has costs and benefits. By itself, it’s not necessarily a bad thing. It lets us sleep at night. Without it, we would prolong the awful pangs of embarrassment. We would torture ourselves with regret over the road not taken or over how badly we navigated the road we did take. We would agonize in the aftermath of almost every decision: Did we do the right thing, marry the right person, buy the right house, choose the best car, enter the right career? Yet mindless self-justification, like quicksand, can draw us deeper into disaster. It blocks our ability to even see our errors, let alone correct them. It distorts reality, keeping us from getting all the information we need and assessing issues clearly. It prolongs and widens rifts between lovers, friends, and nations. It keeps us from letting go of unhealthy habits. It permits the guilty to avoid taking responsibility for their deeds. And it keeps many professionals from changing outdated attitudes and procedures that can be harmful to the public.

Cognitive dissonance is a state of tension that occurs whenever a person holds two cognitions (ideas, attitudes, beliefs, opinions) that are psychologically inconsistent, such as “Smoking is a dumb thing to do because it could kill me” and “I smoke two packs a day.” Dissonance produces mental discomfort, ranging from minor pangs to deep anguish; people don’t rest easy until they find a way to reduce it.

Dissonance theory also exploded the self-flattering idea that we humans, being Homo sapiens, process information logically. On the contrary: If the new information is consonant with our beliefs, we think it is well founded and useful: “Just what I always said!” But if the new information is dissonant, then we consider it biased or foolish: “What a dumb argument!”

So powerful is the need for consonance that when people are forced to look at disconfirming evidence, they will find a way to criticize, distort, or dismiss it so that they can maintain or even strengthen their existing belief. This mental contortion is called the “confirmation bias.”6

Children learn to justify their aggressive actions early: They hit a younger sibling, who starts to cry, and immediately claim, “But he started it! He deserved it!” Most parents find these childish self-justifications to be of no great consequence, and usually they aren’t. But it is sobering to realize that the same mechanism underlies the behavior of gangs who bully weaker children, employers who mistreat workers, lovers who abuse each other, police officers who continue beating a suspect who has surrendered, tyrants who imprison and torture ethnic minorities, and soldiers who commit atrocities against civilians.

When people do a good deed, particularly when they do it on a whim or by chance, they will come to see the beneficiary of their generosity in a warmer light. Their cognition that they went out of their way to do a favor for this person is dissonant with any negative feelings they might have had about him. In effect, after doing the favor, they ask themselves: “Why would I do something nice for a jerk? Therefore, he’s not as big a jerk as I thought he was— as a matter of fact, he is a pretty nice guy who deserves a break.”

Dissonance reduction operates like a thermostat, keeping our self-esteem bubbling along on high. That is why we are usually oblivious to the self-justifications, the little lies to ourselves that prevent us from even acknowledging that we made mistakes or foolish decisions. But dissonance theory applies to people with low self-esteem, too, to people who consider themselves to be schnooks, crooks, or incompetents. They are not surprised when their behavior confirms their negative self-image. When they make a wrongheaded prediction or go through a severe initiation to get into a dull group, they merely say, “Yup, I screwed up again; that’s just like me.”

Along with the confirmation bias, the brain comes packaged with other self-serving habits that allow us to justify our own perceptions and beliefs as being accurate, realistic, and unbiased.

Naïve realism creates a logical labyrinth because it presupposes two things: One, people who are open-minded and fair ought to agree with a reasonable opinion. And two, any opinion I hold must be reasonable; if it weren’t, I wouldn’t hold it. Therefore, if I can just get my opponents to sit down here and listen to me, so I can tell them how things really are, they will agree with me. And if they don’t, it must be because they are biased.

With every innocent person freed from years in prison through DNA testing, the public can almost hear the mental machinations of prosecutors, police, and judges who are busy resolving dissonance. One strategy is to claim that most of those cases don’t reflect wrongful convictions but wrongful pardons: Just because a prisoner is exonerated doesn’t mean he or she is innocent. And if the person really is innocent, well, that’s a shame, but wrongful convictions are extremely rare, a reasonable price to pay for the superb system we already have in place.

When mistakes or misconduct occur, Marquis added, the system has many self-correcting procedures in place to fix them immediately. In fact, he worries, if we start tinkering with the system to make corrections designed to reduce the rate of wrongful convictions, we will end up freeing too many guilty people. This claim reflects the perverted logic of self-justification.

Social psychologist June Tangney has found that being criticized for who you are rather than for what you did evokes a deep sense of shame and helplessness; it makes a person want to hide, disappear.6 Because the shamed person has nowhere to go to escape the desolate feeling of humiliation, Tangney found, shamed spouses tend to strike back in anger: “You make me feel that I did an awful thing because I’m reprehensible and incompetent. Since I don’t think I am reprehensible and incompetent, you must be reprehensible to humiliate me this way.”

By the time a couple’s style of argument has escalated into shaming and blaming each other, the very purpose of their quarrels has shifted. It is no longer an effort to solve a problem or even to get the other person to modify his or her behavior; it’s just to wound, to insult, to score. That is why shaming leads to fierce, renewed efforts at self-justification, a refusal to compromise, and the most destructive emotion a relationship can evoke: contempt.

Letting go of the self-justifications that cover up our mistakes, that protect our desires to do things just the way we want to, and that minimize the hurts we inflict on those we love can be embarrassing and painful. Without self-justification, we might be left standing emotionally naked, unprotected, in a pool of regrets and losses. Yet, in the final analysis, we believe it is worth it, because no matter how painful it can be to let go of self-justification, the result teaches us something deeply important about ourselves and can bring the peace of insight and self-acceptance.

We have all done something that made others angry at us, and we have all been spurred to anger by what others have done to us. We all have, intentionally or unintentionally, hurt another person who will forever regard us as the villain, the betrayer, the scoundrel. And we have all felt the sting of being on the receiving end of an act of injustice, nursing a wound that never seems to fully heal. The remarkable thing about self-justification is that it allows us to shift from one role to the other and back again in the blink of an eye, without applying what we have learned from one role to the other.

The focus on constant testing, which grew out of the reasonable desire to measure and standardize children’s accomplishments, has intensified their fear of failure.

My girlfriend is so beautiful that she has never had cause to develop any kind of personality. People are always wildly glad to see her, even though she does little more than sit around and smoke. She’s getting prettier, too. Last time she left the house she caused six car crashes, two coronaries, about thirty domestic disputes and an estimated six hundred unwanted and embarrassing erections. She seems to be quite indifferent to the havoc she causes. ‘I’m going to the shop for cigarettes,’ she’ll say, yawning with that succulent, glossy mouth. ‘I suppose you’d better call some ambulances or something.’

My girlfriend died. I was heartbroken, and vowed to remain faithful to her memory. At first I had no difficulty; my distress was so great that I couldn’t even contemplate kissing anyone else. But, after a while, another girl started showing an interest. I resisted her advances. ‘You’re very pretty,’ I told her, ‘but it’s just too soon. I’m sorry.’ She wouldn’t give up. She kept gently touching me, and fluttering her mascara-coated eyelashes. Eventually I yielded, and fell into her arms. The man asked us to leave.

The drum language is creative, freely generating neologisms for innovations from the north: steamboats, cigarettes, and the Christian god being three that Carrington particularly noted. But drummers begin by learning the traditional fixed formulas. Indeed, the formulas of the African drummers sometimes preserve archaic words that have been forgotten in the everyday language. For the Yaunde, the elephant is always “the great awkward one.” The resemblance to Homeric formulas—not merely Zeus, but Zeus the cloud-gatherer; not just the sea, but the wine-dark sea—is no accident. In an oral culture, inspiration has to serve clarity and memory first. The Muses are the daughters of Mnemosyne.

Another specialized language provides a perfect analog: the language of aviation radio. Numbers and letters make up much of the information passed between pilots and air traffic controllers: altitudes, vectors, aircraft tail numbers, runway and taxiway identifiers, radio frequencies. This is critical communication over a notoriously noisy channel, so a specialized alphabet is employed to minimize ambiguity. The spoken letters B and V are easy to confuse; bravo and victor are safer. M and N become mike and november. In the case of numbers, five and nine, particularly prone to confusion, are spoken as fife and niner. The extra syllables perform the same function as the extra verbosity of the talking drums.

He has to care about what he is doing, not because a parent or a teacher says so, but for its own sake.

Ericsson calls it ‘deliberate practice’, to distinguish it from what most of the rest of us get up to. I am going to call it purposeful practice. Why? Because the practice sessions of aspiring champions have a specific and never-changing purpose: progress. Every second of every minute of every hour, the goal is to extend one’s mind and body, to push oneself beyond the outer limits of one’s capacities, to engage so deeply in the task that one leaves the training session, literally, a changed person.

For years, their success had been put down to faster reaction speeds, secret diet, and any number of mysterious factors. Others suggested that it was because they were training longer hours. But they were not training longer; they were training smarter. They were training more purposefully. They were, in effect, training on turbo-drive.

When we learn a new task, like driving a car, we concentrate hard to master the skills. At first we are slow and awkward, and our movements are characterized by conscious control, but as we get more familiar, the skills are absorbed in implicit memory, and we no longer give much thought to them. We cruise along, attending to other things while at the wheel. This is what psychologists call ‘automaticity’.

Jack Nicklaus – a master in the art of purposeful practice – always created a clear idea of precisely what he wanted to achieve on every shot. ‘I never hit a shot, even in practice, without having a very sharp, in-focus picture of it in my head,’ he said. ‘It’s like a colour movie. First I “see” the ball where I want it to finish, nice and white and sitting up high on the bright green grass. Then the scene quickly changes and I “see” the ball going there; its path, trajectory, and shape, even its behaviour on landing.’ Nicklaus did not create this vivid mental representation for the fun of it, but so that he could gain access to the most detailed feedback possible. By comparing the outcome of the shot with the ‘colour movie’ of his intention, he was able to learn and adapt in the most efficient way on every single stroke he ever played. It is difficult to exaggerate the power of the forces unleashed by this kind of learning.

This migration from the explicit to the implicit system of the brain has two crucial advantages. First, it enables the expert player to integrate the various parts of a complex skill into one fluent whole (this ‘motor chunking’ is akin to the perceptual chunking described in chapter 1), something that would be impossible at a conscious level because there are too many interconnecting variables for the conscious mind to handle.

Think about the mechanics of vision for a moment or two. We all have an intuitive understanding of how this works: light bounces off objects, enters our eyes, and is focused on the retina by the lens. This retinal image is then sent to the brain, where it is ‘experienced’. In this account of perception, the eye operates as a kind of camera, with the brain getting access to the picture via the delivery system of the optic nerve. But a little reflection shows that this account must be flawed. After all, if the retinal image is like a photograph, which is sent to the brain, who is sitting in the brain to ‘see’ the incoming picture?

It’s noteworthy that many of the contemporaries of Galileo (inventor of the modern telescope) really did think there was something morally dubious about the telescope; that it was taking humanity beyond the powers expressly sanctioned by God. They were the moral conservatives of their day. It is not difficult to imagine that those currently opposing genetic enhancement may one day be seen in the same light.

Finding genetic differences between populations is common. Small populations have genetic traits that are often different from those of other populations: the short-limbed Inuit, for example, are different from the Australian Aborigines. Such differences exist across the planet. But why lump together all the diverse populations that happen to share similar skin pigmentation? The problem for the racial scientist is his yearning to generalize.

Far from being a ‘black’ phenomenon, or an East African phenomenon, or even a Kenyan phenomenon, distance running is actually a Nandi phenomenon focused on the town of Eldoret. Or, to put it another way, much of the ‘black’ distance running success is focused on the tiniest of pinpricks on the map of Africa, with the vast majority of the continent under-represented.

It would seem that the notion of race is so deeply embedded within the human psyche that there is a collective blind spot when it comes to its use and meaning. We automatically put people of dark skin in a box marked ‘black’, and assume that any trait shared by some (even a tiny minority) is shared by all.

The reason why racial scientists are able to get away with statistically flawed generalizations is because they tally with our natural inclination to regard ‘black’ as a biological type distinct from ‘white’ or ‘yellow’ or ‘red’. Indeed, this inclination is so powerful that it requires an effort of will to free oneself from its clutches.

Living at altitude is not, of course, sufficient to create running success all on its own, as the dearth of elite Nepalese and Peruvian runners demonstrates. But when you also factor in the remarkable fact that many of Kenya’s top runners ran extraordinarily long distances to school, sometimes in excess of twenty kilometres per day, it is possible to see the beginnings of a persuasive explanation for the Nandi running phenomenon.

Perhaps the most pernicious problem is that these stereotypes have the tendency to be self-perpetuating. If black people cotton on to the fact that educational success is being overlooked by employers, they may take a (perfectly rational) decision to focus their efforts elsewhere, causing a further decline in black educational standards. Over time, this will mean that the background assumptions of employers (that blacks are less intellectually qualified than whites) will be permanently reflected in hard reality.

Perhaps the most graphic demonstration of the power of stereotyping occurred in an experiment undertaken by Jeff Stone and colleagues in 1997. They took white and black former high-school athletes and gave them a golf-putting task. They found that the two groups performed equally well. But when the participants were told that the task was a measure of ‘natural athletic ability’, the whites’ performance deteriorated. The very fact that whites felt they were being judged against a negative stereotype caused them to mess up. This is known as stereotype threat.

It is involved in making complex cost-benefit analyses of immediate and future consequences.

Stonehenge was built in different phases over many hundreds of years. To begin with, in about 3100 BC, it was a circular ditch with an internal bank and fifty-six holes around its perimeter. A few hundred years later two circles of bluestone were erected. Bluestone is not native to Wiltshire but comes from the Preseli Hills in Pembrokeshire in West Wales. After that the bluestones were dug up and rearranged and the familiar sarsen stones brought to the site. These form Stonehenge’s most famous image of the pillars with lintels across the top.

Fromm argues that freedom is composed of two complementary parts. A common view of freedom is that it means “freedom from the political, economic, and spiritual shackles that have bound men,” which defines it as the absence of others forcibly interfering with the pursuit of our goals. In contrast to this “freedom from,” Fromm identifies an alternate sense of freedom as an ability: the “freedom to” attain certain outcomes and realize our full potential. “Freedom from” and “freedom to” don’t always go together, but one must be free in both senses to obtain full benefit from choice.

We tend to take it for granted in the United States that the moment a new product enters the marketplace, it will be viewed as another option. A new flavor of soda expands your choice set. But with the perspective that such additional options do not represent more choice, it’s no wonder that the citizens of formerly communist countries reacted to the proliferation of such “choices” with skepticism.

And the tool with which we unearth the pièce de résistance is none other than choice. Your choices of which clothes to wear or which soda to drink, where you live, which school to attend and what to study, and of course your profession all say something about you, and it’s your job to make sure that they are an accurate reflection of who you really are.

A wide variety of studies have shown that across the board, no matter what the ability in question, only the most minute fraction of people are willing to describe themselves as “below average.” Ninety percent of us believe ourselves to be in the top 10 percent in terms of overall intelligence and ability.

Clearly, the way we frame information for ourselves or for others can make a big difference in how we see and respond to choice. Every time we encounter new information or reexamine old information, we’re influenced by its presentation. We can use framing to our advantage, but sometimes it has a negative impact on the quality of our decisions. For example, when framing highlights the costs of a given set of options instead of the benefits, we may become subject to bias.

The pages of economic history are rife with bubbles: Single tulip bulbs sold for more than the average person’s annual income during the Dutch tulip mania of the seventeenth century; the stock speculation of the Roaring Twenties contributed to the Great Depression; and the dot-com bubble threw the country into a recession less than a decade before the housing crash. Unable to see the forest for the trees—or the bubble surrounding the houses—people focused on trends that turned out to be unsustainable.

If we’re partial to one option—perhaps because it’s more memorable, or framed to minimize loss, or seemingly consistent with a promising pattern—we tend to search for information that will justify choosing that option. On the one hand, it’s sensible to make choices that we can defend with data and a list of reasons. On the other hand, if we’re not careful, we’re likely to conduct an imbalanced analysis, falling prey to a cluster of errors collectively known as “confirmation biases.”

Through creative self-teaching and hard work, Ekman found a way to combine the automatic system with the reflective one, allowing him to make snap judgments that are also highly accurate.

In the words of Herbert Simon, a Nobel laureate and one of the most influential scholars of the century, “Intuition is nothing more and nothing less than recognition.” The automatic system doesn’t make predictions or apply theoretical knowledge; it reacts to whatever situation a person is currently facing. It will be accurate in novel situations only if they’re similar to previously experienced ones, making an extensive body of hands-on expertise a prerequisite for developing informed intuition.

Achieving a world-class expert-level understanding of a single domain, it takes an average of 10,000 hours of practice, or about three hours a day, every day, for ten years straight. And practice alone isn’t enough. As we saw earlier, the considerable professional experience of doctors and political pundits doesn’t necessarily protect them from framing and confirmation biases. You can’t simply do X for three hours a day for ten years and expect to end up as the world champion of X.

When we try to determine how we’ll feel in the future about the decisions we made today, we extrapolate based on our current feelings. In doing so, we often succumb to some of the same biases that we saw earlier in the chapter. For example, we tend to overestimate how intense our reaction will be because we focus on a vivid scenario, ignoring the larger context in which it will take place. Sports fans may predict that they’ll be devastated if their team loses and overjoyed if it wins, but they don’t factor in all the other elements of the day—weather, commute, deadlines at work, family dinner—that will contribute to their overall emotional state.

Chances are, you see a jolly fat man wearing a bright red suit and cap, black boots and belt, and a generous smile on his rosy face. This image of Santa Claus was created by Swedish illustrator Haddon Sundblom, who was commissioned by the Coca-Cola Company to draw advertisements of St. Nick delivering Cokes to the thirsty children of the world. “Prior to the Sundblom illustrations, the Christmas saint had been variously illustrated wearing blue, yellow, green, or red,” Mark Pendergrast writes in For God, Country and Coca-Cola.

One could argue that in our world, each brain acts as a node, an individual neural interactive simulator, in a giant network of simulators. The sum of the activity of all these simulators creates our world, and each person perceives that world through his or her own simulator. The only way to avoid the influence of the other simulators would be to opt out of the network, to sever all connections, to live only in one’s own head.

We tend to have a knee-jerk negative response to anything that seems to want or have control over us. We worry that if we give up any control, we may eventually become nothing more than robots. Our anxiety is not always unwarranted, but too much of it is counterproductive. The problem may lie in the fact that we tend to put choice on a pedestal, so much so that we expect to be able to bend everything to our will. We would serve ourselves better by separating the influences that conflict with our values from the influences that are basically harmless. We can then consciously examine our reasoning process to combat some of the covert effects of the negative influences.

The difference is that experts can simplify their own choices, which in turn allows them to take full advantage of the opportunities provided by more choice. Novices, on the other hand, are reliant on choice providers to reduce the number of choices they provide, in which case they’ll benefit—but not as much as the experts. If providers keep offering lots of choice, they’ll eventually be overwhelmed.

If choice is indeed something we make, as we make art and make music, then surely we can look to those creative disciplines for guidance. The key, however, is to recognize—to return to the words of de Tocqueville—that in order to “hold fast” to something, one must allow oneself to be held to something. That commitment may be one of the hardest things to practice in a world of so much choice.

In a conversation with the master jazz musician and Pulitzer Prize-winning composer Wynton Marsalis, he told me, “You need to have some restrictions in jazz. Anyone can improvise with no restrictions, but that’s not jazz. Jazz always has some restrictions. Otherwise it might sound like noise.” The ability to improvise, he said, comes from fundamental knowledge, and this knowledge “limits the choices you can make and will make. Knowledge is always important where there’s a choice.” The resulting action is based on informed intuition, or as he calls it, “superthought.”

We learn very early in life that some things are simply not allowed, and we don’t take this lying down. In our terrible twos, we throw tantrums and juice boxes; in our teens, we slam doors and sneak out windows. The characters in many of our most compelling and enduring stories try—and often fail—to resist the lure of the forbidden. Eat any fruit but the one on this tree? Love anyone but the son of the enemy? We know how that turns out. Call it disobedience, defiance, or rebellion. In the 1960s, psychologist Jack Brehm called it “reactance” and explained it as follows: [W]hen a person believes himself free to engage in a given behavior, he will experience psychological reactance if that freedom is eliminated or threatened with elimination.

If you read Choose Your Own Adventure books as a child, you probably recall what a thrill it was to play the protagonist and influence the narrative through your choices. And part of the fun was the cheating. When you had to pick from three options to continue the story, occasionally you’d take a peek at the consequences of each one before making a choice. It was great to control your actions, but you didn’t want to end up in a dragon’s belly because of them. A few wrong turns were fine—you could always go back—but the final goal was to make it all the way, to win! As adults, we write our lives through choice, we have more control than ever before, but we still have a desire to win. Sometimes we’d like to be readers rather than writers, to cheat by turning to later pages, to read ahead in the story of our lives.

We tell stories about choice for many reasons. We want to learn or teach; we want to know others or have them know us; we want to understand how we got from there to here. We take the choices that for some reason or other have lit up like stars across our memory, and we chart our journey by them. This is why I won the race. This is how I survived. This is when everything changed. Through these stories we assert that what we do matters. By speaking choice, we find a way to navigate the strange waters of life, maybe even appreciate their unpredictable movement.

Once the proportion of people going to university goes over a critical threshold, people have to go to university in order to get a decent job. When, say, 50 per cent of the population goes to university, not going to university is implicitly declaring that you are in the bottom half of the ability distribution, which is not the greatest way to start your job search. So, people go to university, fully knowing that they will ‘waste time’ studying things that they will never need for their work. With everyone wanting to go to university, the demand for higher education increases, which then leads to the supply of more university places, which raises university enrolment rate further, increasing the pressure to go to university even more. Over time, this leads to a process of degree inflation. Now that ‘everyone’ has a university degree, you have to do a master’s, or even a PhD, in order to stand out, even if the productivity content of those further degrees may be minimal for your future jobs.

The contradiction is that they train people to be entrepreneurial, because it looks and feels good, but entrepreneurship is completely useless in most corporates – they don't need it! They need people who will help the blunt-nosed tanker to stay on course and the crew to buckle down. So you end up with all these great 'entrepreneurial leaders' being useless, with sod-all management skill or knowledge.

"Self-leadership: it's the capacity and the commitment to take responsibility and create outcomes that are meaningful to you. It is the opposite of shifting responsibility for those outcomes onto other people or circumstances. Learning to lead ourselves is a challenge. But it is an essential capability, as it is what enables us to not only achieve our own goals, but also to understand how we can inspire others to do it for themselves. We are not motivated by others. Motivation is an inside job; and what leaders do is to help others to identify and tap into what is important to them, so that they are personally motivated to go the extra mile. Ultimately, it always starts with you."

And that would have to be our throughput—not the rate at which Ron walks the trail, but the rate at which I do. What about the amount of trail between Ron and me? It has to be inventory. Ron is consuming raw materials, so the trail the rest of us are walking is inventory until it passes behind me. And what is operational expense?

Ricky Gervais, meanwhile, clearly loves action and calls with almost anything. For a time, his confidence pays off as the more experienced players fold against him. He calls with 62 offsuit, hits sixes and deuces on the flop and makes money. But, probably not knowing why he’s winning, he doesn’t know when to change gear. If you keep calling with 62 offsuit, you’re going to start losing. Sure enough, his chip lead is gradually whittled away and he’s the first out. He doesn’t seem happy about it. ‘What am I supposed to do now?’ he asks. ‘There’s a shotgun in the drawer,’ says Stephen Fry.

"If we cut our batch sizes in half, then I guess that at any one time we’d have half the workin-process on the floor. I guess that means we’d only need half the investment in work-in-process to keep the plant working. If we could work it out with our vendors, we could conceivably cut all our inventories in half, and by cutting our inventories in half, we reduce the amount of cash tied up at any one time, which eases the pressure on cash flow.’’

"Since we began withholding materials from the floor until the bottlenecks are ready for them, the non-bottlenecks now have idle time. It’s perfectly okay to have more setups on non-bottlenecks, because all we’re doing is cutting into time the machines would spend being idle. Saving setups at a non-bottleneck doesn’t make the system one bit more productive. The time and money saved is an illusion. Even if we double the number of setups, it won’t consume all the idle time.’’

Before we reduced batch sizes, it wasn’t uncommon for a work center to be forced idle because it didn’t have anything to process—even though we were wading through excess inventory. It was usually because the idle work center had to wait for the one preceding it to finish a large batch of some item. Unless told otherwise by an expeditor, the materials handlers would wait until an entire batch was completed before moving it. In fact, that’s still the case. But now that the batches are smaller, the parts are ready to be moved to the next work station sooner than they were before.

What was the nature of the answers, the solutions, that Jonah caused us to develop? They all had one thing in common. They all made common sense, and at the same time, they flew directly in the face of everything I’d ever learned. Would we have had the courage to try to implement them if it weren’t for the fact that we’d had to sweat to construct them? Most probably not. If it weren’t for the conviction that we gained in the struggle—for the ownership that we developed in the process—I don’t think we’d actually have had the guts to put our solutions into practice.

What career to follow, how to manage a business, whom to marry, how to bring up children, and whether to run for president are just some examples of such fateful choices. The common element in these situations is that you do not act in a vacuum. Instead, you are surrounded by active decision makers whose choices interact with yours.

Sailboat racing offers the chance to observe an interesting reversal of a “follow the leader” strategy. The leading sailboat usually copies the strategy of the trailing boat. When the follower tacks, so does the leader. The leader imitates the follower even when the follower is clearly pursuing a poor strategy. Why? Because in sailboat racing (unlike ballroom dancing) close doesn’t count; only winning matters. If you have the lead, the surest way to stay ahead is to play monkey see, monkey do.*

There are two ways to move second. You can imitate as soon as the other has revealed his approach (as in sailboat racing) or wait longer until the success or failure of the approach is known (as in computers). The longer wait is more advantageous in business because, unlike in sports, the competition is usually not winner-take-all. As a result, market leaders will not follow the upstarts unless they also believe in the merits of their course.

De Gaulle’s intransigence denied the other party an opportunity to come back with a counteroffer that was acceptable. In practice, this is easier said than done, for two kinds of reasons. The first kind stems from the fact that bargaining usually involves considerations other than the pie on today’s table. The perception that you have been excessively greedy may make others less willing to negotiate with you in the future. Or, next time they may be more firm bargainers as they try to recapture some of their perceived losses. On a personal level, an unfair win may spoil business relations, or even personal relations.

The second kind of problem lies in achieving the necessary degree of intransigence. Luther and de Gaulle achieved this through their personalities, but this entails a cost. An inflexible personality is not something you can just turn on and off. Although being inflexible can sometimes wear down an opponent and force him to make concessions, it can equally well allow small losses to grow into major disasters.

The importance of randomized strategies was one of the early insights of game theory. The idea is simple and intuitive but needs refinement to be useful in practice. It is not enough for a tennis player to know that he should mix his shots between the opponent’s forehand and backhand. He needs some idea of whether he should go to the forehand 30 percent or 64 percent of the time and how the answer depends on the relative strengths of the two sides.

If you happen to be a farmer with soy beans to sell in the future, then the contract can provide a hedge against future price movements. Similarly, if you sell soy milk and hence need to buy soy beans in the future, this contract is insurance, not a gamble. But the volume of the contracts on the exchange suggests that most people buying and selling are traders, not farmers and manufacturers. For them, the deal is a zero-sum game. When both sides agree to trade, each one thinks it will make money. One of them must be wrong. That’s the nature of a zero-sum game. Both sides can’t win. This is a paradox. How can both sides think that they can out-smart the other? Someone must be wrong.

In poker, players battle this paradox when it comes to raising the stakes. If a player bets only when he has a strong hand, the other players will soon figure this out. In response to a raise, most other players will fold, and he’ll never win a big pot. Those who raise back will have even stronger hands, and so our poor player will end up a big loser. To get others to bet against a strong hand, they have to think you might be bluffing. To convince them of this possibility, it helps to bet often enough so that you must be bluffing some of the time. This leads to an interesting dilemma. You’d like others to fold against your bluffs and thereby win with weak hands. But that won’t lead to high-pot victories. To convince others to raise your bets, you also need to get caught bluffing.

Our point in creating it was to illustrate a critical lesson in game theory: you need to understand the other player’s perspective. You need to consider what they know, what motivates them, and even how they think about you. George Bernard Shaw’s quip on the golden rule was to not do unto others as you would have them do unto you—their tastes may be different. When thinking strategically, you have to work extra hard to understand the perspective and interactions of all the other players in the game, including ones who may be silent.

The general principle for sequential-move games is that each player should figure out the other players’ future responses and use them in calculating his own best current move. This idea is so important that it is worth codifying into a basic rule of strategic behavior: RULE 1: Look forward and reason backward.

Players have such perfect knowledge of the other player’s or players’ objectives in many simple games and sports, but that is not necessarily the case in games people play in business, politics, and social interactions. Motives in such games are complex combinations of selfishness and altruism, concern for justice or fairness, short-run and long-run considerations, and so on.

The ultimatum game has two players, a “proposer,” say A, a “responder,” say B, and a sum of money, say 100 dollars. Player A begins the game by proposing a division of the 100 dollars between the two. Then B decides whether to agree to A’s proposal. If B agrees, the proposal is implemented; each player gets what A proposed and the game ends. If B refuses, then neither player gets anything, and the game ends.

To distinguish between altruism and strategy, experiments were done using a variant called the dictator game. Here the proposer dictates how the available total is to be split; the other player has no say in the matter at all. Proposers in the dictator game give away significantly smaller sums on average than they offer in the ultimatum game, but they give away substantially more than zero.

The best chess players are usually distinguished by the depth and subtlety of their knowledge. Knowledge can be distilled from the observation of many games and many players and then codified into rules. This has been done most extensively with regard to openings, that is, the first ten or even fifteen moves of a game. There are hundreds and hundreds of books that analyze different openings and discuss their relative merits and drawbacks.

I think nostalgia is a primal emotion, like fear and anger and (maybe) love. It just seems otherwise, because it has a long name and is tricky to define out loud. So you might mistake it for one of those fiddly, sophisticated feelings like schadenfreude or low self-esteem. But nostalgia is simple, basic, instinctive and it was always there. You can see it on the face of a zoo monkey that once lived in the wild. Or even one that never did. It still knows that it has lost something.

Using valid data eliminates a major cause of confusion, uncertainty,  and resulting inefficiency in problem solving. Valid data encompasses   two things: (1) objective data, data about ideas, events, or situations   that everyone accepts as facts, and (2) personal data.  Personal data are also "facts," but they concern how individuals  feel about what is happening to them and around them.

Because consultants or staff people have no direct control over  implementation, they become very dependent on line managers  for producing results. The line manager ultimately will decide  whether to take action, and this choice will be based on how internally   committed the line manager is to the concepts the consultant  is suggesting. So the consultant needs to be very conscious of  building internal commitment all during the consulting process.

Values in themselves are just words, devoid of any real content. So when a company’s values are presented as a list of bullet points in the Annual Report, at executive meetings or in an image brochure, they become anonymous and irrelevant, speaking to the mind but not to the heart. When you tell a story on the other hand, those terms come to life through powerful images and place your values in a more dynamic context.

But at the same time, the stories have to mirror a realistic balance between the desired future and the present situation.

Storytelling can take on a variety of forms in the universe of advertising. Largely, it simply comes down to creating a recognisable and relevant universe where the company or its products take on a natural role in the story. But it is the characters and their actions, and the conflicts they try to resolve that drive the story forward. The story however, can only be effective if on some level we can identify with the characters; if we are able to laugh at them or recognise ourselves in the way they behave.

Do help the client express the reservations about you and your  product.
Do admit you are there to sell and want them to buy.

The client keeps reminding you that they live in the "Realworld  and are facing Realworld problems." I must have heard about the  Realworld a thousand times-it makes me wonder where clients  think consultants live. This form of resistance from the client  accuses us of being impractical and academic.

When you have completed a study,
you can tell a manager that the building has collapsed, the workers   have just walked out, the chief financial officer has just run off  with the vice president of marketing, and the IRS is knocking on  the door, and the manager's first response is, "I'm not surprised."  It's like being surprised is the worst thing in the world that could  happen. The manager's fear of surprise is really the desire to  always be in control.

Beware the silent client. If you think  a meeting went smoothly because the manager didn't raise any  objections, don't trust it. Ask yourself whether the client gave you  any real support or showed any real enthusiasm or got personally  involved in the action. If there were few signs of life, begin to wonder   whether silence was the form the client's resistance was taking.

Moralizing can be seductive to the consultant. The moralizing  manager is inviting you to join him or her in a very select circle of  people who know what is best for "those people" and who know  what they "need to understand." This is an elite position to be in;  it has the feeling of power and it is well-protected-if the rest of  the organization does not appreciate what you do, this is just further   indication how confused they are and how much more they  need you! Resist the temptation with as much grace and persistence   as possible.

The most difficult form of resistance to see comes from the compliant   manager who totally agrees with you and eagerly wants to  know what to do next. It is hard to see compliance as resistance  because you are getting exactly what you want-agreement and  respect. If you really trust the concept that in each manager there  is some ambivalence about your help, then when you get no negative   reaction at all, you know something is missing.

The  consultant accomplishes this by internally moving from feelings of  low impact, distance, and poor information to a position of high  impact, authenticity, and clarity.

We all see couples who  have been married for ten years and seem to be suffering every  minute they are together. We wonder why they stay together.  Perhaps it is because at least they know how bad things can get.  They know what the downside looks like, and they know they can  survive. There is comfort in knowing what to expect. To separate  would be unpredictable. The fear of coping with unpredictability  may be greater than the pain of staying together.

PEOPLE USE THE PHRASE "overcoming resistance" as though resistance   or defensiveness were an adversary to be wrestled to the  ground and subdued. "Overcoming resistance" would have you  use data and logical arguments to win the point and convince the  client. There is no way you can talk clients out of their resistance,  because resistance is an emotional process. Behind the resistance are  certain feelings. You cannot talk people out of how they are feeling.

There are three specific steps for handling resistance.
Step 1: Identify in your own mind what form the resistance is taking.   The skill is to pick up the cues from the manager and then, in  your head, to put some words on what you see happening.
Step 2: State, in a neutral, nonpunishing way, the form the resistance   is taking. This is called "naming the resistance." The skill is  to find the neutral language.
Step 3: Be quiet. Let the line manager respond to your statement  about the resistance.

Tied up in knots like a pretzel

Shaking his head each time you speak
Bent over toward you like a servant

As a way of coping with our despair and frustration, we made a  list of different ways of consulting with a stone.
1. Don't look for approval, emotional support, or affection.
2. Don't expect the responsibility to be shared 50/50. Stones  dump it all on you.
3. Expect argument and criticism.
4. Don't ask for the client's feelings or express your own feelings.
5. Do ask the client for understanding. Don't ask for agreement.
6. Let the client have a lot of control over the procedure used  in the project.
7. Minimize elaborating or explaining the data. Justification  just makes it worse.
8. Give the client support.
9. Don't take the response you are getting personally.
10. Don't get hooked; avoid details.
11. Hope that the client may learn from this project later, after  you are gone. You are not going to get closure from the project   now.
12. Show confidence.
13. Look for comic relief.
14. Remember, the stone's anxiety is over losing control.
15. Keep moving.
16. Avoid stones whenever possible.

Again for all stakeholders, but in particular for project sponsors, you need to be aware that there are a number of types of power that can be present in any organisation. Where does your project sponsor fit? • Legitimate – this can be through a formal title or position (authority). • Reward – this can be through an ability to provide positive consequences for people (carrot). • Coercive – this can be through the ability to provide negative consequences (stick). • Purse string – this can be through budget control (money). • Bureaucratic – this can be through knowledge of the system (intelligence). • Referent – this can be through association with someone else’s power (network). • Technical – this can be through technical knowledge relating to the project (skill). • Charismatic – this can be through personality alone (character).

Axelrod argues that tit for tat embodies four principles that should be present in any effective strategy for the repeated prisoners’ dilemma: clarity, niceness, provocability, and forgivingness. Tit for tat is as clear and simple as you can get; the opponent does not have to do much thinking or calculation about what you are up to. It is nice in that it never initiates cheating. It is provocable—that is, it never lets cheating go unpunished. And it is forgiving, because it does not hold a grudge for too long and is willing to restore cooperation.

The slightest possibility of a mistake or a misperception results in a complete breakdown in the success of tit for tat.

There may also be a frustration component if interruption is frequent. Workers who are frustrated have to use up some of their energy and time to calm themselves and face up to the potential for further frustration when they begin again.

A highly partitioned worker can’t be obsessively involved in any of his/her many fragmented tasks, and so tends not to bind into the team. Whatever the productivity boost due to team action may be, the partitioned worker does not benefit from it.

The survival tactic that Harry and others like him hit upon when their buffers begin to empty is to slow down. He slows down only enough to keep his supply of waiting work stable. If he slowed down more than that, he would appear to be a bottleneck, which would focus management on his work rate. So he doesn’t do that; he slows down just enough. Harry is now busy 100 percent of the time, has a healthy buffer of work waiting for him, and is not a bottleneck. This is a recipe for job security; the guy is obviously an ideal employee, judged by his part in helping the Hurry Up organization to work smoothly.

There is such a thing as a bad schedule. A bad schedule is one that sets a date that is subsequently missed. That’s it. That’s the beginning and the end of how a schedule should be judged.

Overindulgence in work, like overindulgence in anything else, will eventually lead to burnout.

As defense against failure, standard process is a kind of armor. The more worried you are about failure, the heavier the armor you put on. But armor always has a side effect of reduced mobility. The overarmored organization has lost the ability to move and move quickly. When this happens, standard process is the cause of lost mobility. It is, however, not the root cause. The root cause is fear.

The corporate Quality Program, at its heart, is a mechanism for driving out defects. When it succeeds, it will help you produce products that are defect-free, or nearly so. But are those products good for anything? Maybe yes and maybe no, but either way, it’s not due to the Quality Program.

THE OVERSTRESSED ORGANIZATION is so busy making itself efficient that it has clean forgotten how to be effective. The two are not at all the same. You’re efficient when you do something with minimum waste. And you’re effective when you’re doing the right something. It’s possible to be one without the other: efficient but not effective, or effective but not efficient. Of course it is also possible to be both. Possible, but not easy.

So the change you are urging upon your people requires them to abandon their mastery of the familiar, and to become novices once again, to become rank beginners at something with self-definitional importance. People can make this kind of change, but they can only make it if they feel safe. In an unsafe environment, people are not likely to let themselves be thrust into a position of inexperience. They will resist the change, and all your urging won’t shake them from their determination to have no part of it.

When you learn within the context of a team, you have a facilitator: another team member who is advanced somewhat ahead of you in the subject. This is your coach. You have material: a comfortably doable piece of project work that has been carved off for you by your coach to help you master the skill. And you have co-learners: the other team members who are learning at the same time, or who have just been through the experience themselves (and whose faces are still pale).

In times of change, the reward has to come first. Another way to say this is that the basic currency that pays for change is the set of “markers” you can call in for favors done and confidence earned in the past. Great change managers have got a lot of markers to call in. They have built a reservoir of trust and they tap into it to entice their people to embrace change. This is bad news for the new guy on the job who comes in as a stranger to organize and command a change. He has no markers to call in, nothing really to work with except a little “honeymoon capital.” It’s never enough to promise people that benefits coming at some later date will make the change all seem worthwhile. The harsh reality confronting this new manager is that the key activity of change management (the building of trust) had to be done before the change was even given a name.

Busy Man. He’s the one with the latest device in hand, scrolling through messages, or barking into a cell phone as he dashes through the terminal, oblivious to everyone and everything around him—the picture of stress and anxiety. On some level, Busy Man likes acting this way because it proves he’s important. The more bits he drowns in, the more urgent his work becomes; and urgency, to him, equates to importance.

Bits are heavy whether you consume too many or try to ignore them. They have other attributes, too, that are worth knowing. These attributes reveal bits to be a brand new material, bringing with them new challenges and opportunities. Like paper, or steel, or gunpowder, bits must be fully understood, and respected, if they are to be used to any advantage.

These include Busy Man, who shows off the latest upgrade as a symbol of his success, and many techies who are simply in love with technology. For them, productivity isn’t nearly as interesting as endlessly examining and comparing the tools and features that promise it.

Emptiness is at the heart of bit literacy, and that may be an unsettling idea. Emptiness often has negative connotations: “I got nothing out of it.” “This is leaving me empty.” We prefer to have something. We live in a culture, after all, where more is better. The symbol of success is abundance, measured in size and quantity: bigger houses, for example, containing more stuff.

E-mail is just a medium; the content determines what the message truly is and where it belongs. Users should use the right tool for each kind of message: a todo list for todos, a calendar to store appointments, and so on. No message, no matter what it says, belongs in the inbox.

Whatever the incoming volume of messages, don’t worry; the e-mail inbox was empty yesterday, and you can empty it again today. All it takes is this three-step process: Step 1: Read all personal e-mails, then delete them. Step 2: Delete all spam mail. Step 3: Engage FYIs and action items, then delete them. In particular: Delete or file all FYIs, optionally reading them first. Finish all quick “two-minute” todos, then delete them. Move all big todos to a bit-literate todo list, then delete them.

Others maintain the Sent Items folder to function as a separate filing system—a use it was never intended for. Instead, whenever users send a message that they want to save, they should BCC themselves so that it comes back through the inbox, allowing them to engage it in the inbox, along with all other incoming e-mails. Users can then file the message in the right place—a dedicated project folder, for example.

A good exercise to begin each day is to review and prioritize today’s todos: redate non-critical todos into future days, and then sort today’s todos, top to bottom, from most to least important. You then have an ordered list of everything you need to get done today, and you always know what you should be working on at any moment: the todo on the top of the list.

Most people still do what they learned in the atomic era: taking one shot per subject, and never throwing away photos even if they’re mediocre or bad. These practices made sense when film was expensive, but in the digital era they miss out on the advantages of bits—the ability to take many photos, and filter out bad ones, for no extra cost. Most users haven’t learned bit-literate practices and are left with lower quality photos, since they rely on a single photo to capture a moment.

One drawback of metadata is that it can leave users dependent on one particular tool.

People often underestimate the inherent  momentum of a stock. It takes a long time for  populations to grow or stop growing, for wood  to accumulate in a forest, for a reservoir to fill up,  for a mine to be depleted. An economy cannot  build up a large stock of functioning factories and highways and electric  plants overnight, even if a lot of money is available.

Feedbacks-the interconnections, the  information part of the system-can fail for many reasons. Information can  arrive too late or at the wrong place. It can be unclear or incomplete or hard  to interpret. The action it triggers may be too weak or delayed or resource-constrained   or simply ineffective. The goal of the feedback loop may never  be reached by the actual stock.

Resilience is a measure of a system's ability to survive and persist within a  variable environment. The opposite of resilience is brittleness or rigidity.

The more users there are, the more resource is used. The more resource is  used, the less there is per user. If the users follow the bounded rationality of  the commons ("There's no reason for me to be the one to limit my cows!"),  there is no reason for any of them to decrease their use.

in this system, there is a distinction between the actual system state  and the perceived state. The actor tends to believe bad news more than good  news. As actual performance varies, the best results are dismissed as aberrations,   the worst results stay in the memory. The actor thinks things are  worse than they really are.
And to complete this tragic archetype, the desired state of the system is  influenced by the perceived state. Standards aren't absolute. When perceived  performance slips, the goal is allowed to slip.

Escalation, being a reinforcing feedback loop, builds exponentially.  Therefore, it can carry a competition to extremes faster than anyone would  believe possible. If nothing is done to break the loop, the process usually  ends with one or both of the competitors breaking down.

Using accumulated wealth, privilege, special access, or inside information  to create more wealth, privilege, access or information are examples of  the archetype called "success to the successful." This system trap is found  whenever the winners of a competition receive, as part of the reward, the  means to compete even more effectively in the future. That's a reinforcing   feedback loop, which rapidly divides a system into winners who go on  winning, and losers who go on losing.

If the intervention is a drug, you become addicted. The more you are  sucked into an addictive action, the more you are sucked into it again.  One definition of addiction used in Alcoholics Anonymous is repeating  the same stupid behavior over and over and over, and somehow expecting  different results.
Addiction is finding a quick and dirty solution to the symptom of the  problem, which prevents or distracts one from the harder and longer-term  task of solving the real problem. Addictive policies are insidious, because  they are so easy to sell, so simple to fall for.

Shifting the burden, dependence, and addiction arise when  a solution to a systemic problem reduces (or disguises) the  symptoms, but does nothing to solve the underlying problem.  Whether it is a substance that dulls one's perception or a policy  that hides the underlying trouble, the drug of choice interferes  with the actions that could solve the real problem.

Wherever there are rules, there is likely to be rule beating. Rule beating  means evasive action to get around the intent of a system's rules-abiding  by the letter, but not the spirit, of the law. Rule beating becomes a problem   only when it leads a system into large distortions, unnatural behaviors  that would make no sense at all in the absence of the rules. If it gets out of  hand, rule beating can cause systems to produce very damaging behavior  indeed.

the goal is the direction-setter of the system, the definer of discrepancies   that require action, the indicator of compliance, failure, or success  toward which balancing feedback loops work. If the goal is defined badly,  if it doesn't measure what it's supposed to measure, if it doesn't reflect  the real welfare of the system, then the system can't possibly produce a  desirable result.

If you define the goal of a society as GNP, that society will do its best to  produce GNP. Itwill not produce welfare, equity, justice, or efficiency unless  you define a goal and regularly measure and report the state of welfare,  equity, justice, or efficiency. The world would be a different place if instead  of competing to have the highest per capita GNP, nations competed to have  the highest per capita stocks of wealth with the lowest throughput, or the  lowest infant mortality, or the greatest political freedom, or the cleanest  environment, or the smallest gap between the rich and the poor.

Seeking the wrong goal, satisfying the wrong indicator, is a system characteristic   almost opposite from rule beating. In rule beating, the system is  out to evade an unpopular or badly designed rule, while giving the appearance   of obeying it. In seeking the wrong goal, the system obediently follows  the rule and produces its specified result-which is not necessarily what  anyone actually wants.

Physical structure is crucial in a system, but is rarely a leverage point,  because changing it is rarely quick or simple. The leverage point is in proper  design in the first place. After the structure is built, the leverage is in understanding   its limitations and bottlenecks, using it with maximum efficiency,  and refraining from fluctuations or expansions that strain its capacity.

In Chapter Four, we examined the story of the electric meter in a Dutch  housing development-in some of the houses the meter was installed in  the basement; in others it was installed in the front hall. With no other  differences in the houses, electricity consumption was 30 percent lower  in the houses where the meter was in the highly visible location in the  front hall.
I love that story because it's an example of a high leverage point in the
information structure of the system. It's not a parameter adjustment, not  a strengthening or weakening of an existing feedback loop. It's a new loop,  delivering feedback to a place where it wasn't going before.

Systems
• A system is more than the sum of its parts.
• Many of the interconnections in systems operate through the  flow of information.
• The least obvious part of the system, its function or purpose,  is often the most crucial determinant of the system's behavior.
• System structure is the source of system behavior. System  behavior reveals itself as a series of events over time.

Stocks, Flows, and Dynamic Equilibrium
• A stock is the memory of the history of changing flows within  the system.
• If the sum of inflows exceeds the sum of outflows, the stock  level will rise.
• If the sum of outflows exceeds the sum of inflows, the stock  level will fall.
• If the sum of outflows equals the sum of inflows, the stock  level will not change - it will be held in dynamic equilibrium.
• A stock can be increased by decreasing its outflow rate as well  as by increasing its inflow rate.
• Stocks act as delays or buffers or shock absorbers in systems.
• Stocks allow inflows and outflows to be de-coupled and independent.

Causal determinism enables software developers to design, plan, and predict what their software will do in its production environment. They write or modify their code to define or change the future behavior of the system after compilation and deployment. If we ignore bugs, operating system crashes, power failures, account managers, and other environmental hazards for the moment, we can say that these developers’ predictions are often quite accurate.

The recognition that a software development team can construct itself, that it can define its own identity, that it needs to interact with its environment, and that interactions among team members are just as important as the team members themselves (or even more so) can all be attributed to general systems theory.

Cybernetics is the study of regulatory systems that have goals and interact with their environment through feedback mechanisms. The goal of cybernetics itself is to understand the processes in such regulatory systems, which include iterations of acting (having an effect on the environment), sensing (checking the response of the environment), evaluating (comparing the current state with the system’s goal), and back again to acting. This circular process is a fundamental concept in the study of cybernetics.

Epictetus lived in the first century AD and stated that ‘people are disturbed not by the things that happen, but by the views which they take of those things’ – that is, your own thoughts and opinions shape your feelings about and reactions to an event. By accepting this principle, the individual takes personal responsibility for her own reaction to a situation, whether she is stuck in traffic or made redundant, on the understanding that another person may have a different viewpoint and therefore a different reaction.

Thinking about thinking is an underlying principle of CBC. By considering the way she thinks, your client becomes an impartial observer of her own thoughts. Eventually, your client notices the impact of her thoughts.

The contrast between function and procedure is a reflection of the general distinction between describing properties of things and describing how to do things, or, as it is sometimes referred to, the distinction between declarative knowledge and imperative knowledge. In mathematics we are usually concerned with declarative (what is) descriptions, whereas in computer science we are usually concerned with imperative (how to) descriptions.20

Among the tribes of northern Natal in South Africa, the most common greeting, equivalent to “hello” in English, is the expression: Sawu bona. It literally means, “I see you.” If you are a member of the tribe, you might reply by saying Sikhona, “I am here.” The order of the exchange is important: until you see me, I do not exist. It’s as if, when you see me, you bring me into existence.

Ariyaratne reminds us that it is easier to begin initiatives than to bring enduring changes to fruition. At the early stages, excitement comes easily. Later, after you begin to make progress, opposition develops—which can actually mobilize your efforts. People see themselves fighting “a noble battle” against the entrenched forces preserving the status quo. A few small initial victories establish confidence that more progress is just around the corner. Eventually, the initiative is treated with respect: the “enemy outside” begins to espouse all the same goals, objectives, and ideals as those instigating the change. At this point, it is easy for people to think that the work is over. In fact, it may be just starting.

Thinking strategically starts with reflection on the deepest nature of an undertaking and on the central challenges it poses. It develops with understanding of focus and timing. Focus means knowing where to place one’s attention. What is truly essential? What is secondary? What cannot be ignored without risking the success of the enterprise? Timing means having a sense of an unfolding dynamic.

Inevitably, one of the factors that makes significant change difficult is conflict among competing goals and norms: we want to distribute power and authority and yet we also want to improve control and coordination. We want organizations to be more responsive to changes in their environment and yet more stable and coherent in their sense of identity, purpose, and vision. We want high productivity and high creativity. Good strategic thinking brings such dilemmas to the surface, and uses them to catalyze imagination and innovation.

It takes time to develop the knowledge of working as a whole, just as it takes time to develop knowledge of walking or riding a bicycle.

Team members develop new skills and capabilities which alter what they can do and understand. As new capabilities develop, so too do new awarenesses and sensibilities. Over time, as people start to see and experience the world differently, new beliefs and assumptions begin to form, which enables further development of skills and capabilities. This deep learning cycle constitutes the essence of a learning organization—the development not just of new capacities, but of fundamental shifts of mind, individually and collectively.

Deep beliefs are often inconsistent with espoused values in organizations. The organization might espouse an ideal of “empowering” people, but an attitude that “they won’t let us do it” prevails. Thus, even though espoused values change, the culture of the organization tends to remain the same.

When we forget the community nature of the self, we identify our self with our ego. We then assign a primordial value to the ego (part) and see the community (whole) as secondary. We see the community as nothing but a network of contractual commitments to symbolic and economic exchanges. Encounters with others become transactions that can add or subtract to the possessions of the ego. The resulting loss is incalculable—isolation, loneliness, and loss of our “sense of place.”

Philosophers have given the name “naive realism” to the worldview which holds rigid positions like the primacy of the parts and the isolated nature of the self. This worldview takes reality as a given entity outside our perception, and sees language as the tool through which we describe this external reality “out there.” But as Heisenberg suggests, we have no actual way of ever knowing what is “out there.” Whenever we articulate what we see, our language interacts with our direct experience. The “reality” we bring forth arises from this interaction.

“theory-less” tools are not likely to significantly add to our store of generalizable knowledge. Without underlying theory, you get tools which might work in one situation, but you don’t know why. They might fail in other situations, but you don’t know why either. Ultimately the tool’s usefulness may depend on unreproducible aspects of a particular person’s skill. A really good consultant can make the tool work. But all the rest of the people in your company haven’t got the foggiest idea how to apply it effectively. Second, with no underlying theory, we may not always appreciate the limitations of a tool, or even its counterproductiveness if used inappropriately. In our rush to solve practical problems, we may grab at ready-made solutions that neither address the fundamental causes of a problem, nor stretch our thinking in important new directions. Herein lies the strongest reason to look for tools based on important new theories: only such tools have the power to change how we think. Most tools introduced into management to solve problems, however innovative they may be, are based on conventional ways of thinking. After all, without an underlying theory, how could they be otherwise? Such tools may be useful, but they will not be transformative. They often leave deeper sources of problems unchanged. To paraphrase Albert Einstein, our present problems cannot be solved at the level of thinking at which they were created. For example, many useful “systems analysis” tools are available for diagramming, analyzing, and redesigning organizational work flow processes. Some of these tools have been applied and refined over many years. But virtually all of them are based on a static way of seeing the world. They recognize that “everything in the system is connected,” but they characterize that connectedness in terms of “detail complexity.” They help to create a snapshot showing how a system works at a moment in time. This helps to rearrange the elements of that system into a more ideal picture. But conventional static systems analysis tools offer no understanding of how the problems we have today have developed over time, especially if the causes are nonobvious. Nor will they help in understanding the likely consequences of our future efforts at change, especially where we might take actions that make things better today but worse tomorrow. Because they are a product of our present ways of thinking, static systems tools will tend to merely reinforce the notion that “somebody else” created our problems. They offer no penetrating insights into how our own actions may have caused our present problems—or how our own perspective led us to the obvious “fixes” that eventually made our problems worse. For this you need a dynamic, not a static, perspective.

In sports and in the performing arts, two settings where teams consistently enhance their capabilities, players move regularly between a practice field and the real game, between rehearsal and performance. It is impossible to imagine a basketball team learning without practice, or a chamber music ensemble learning without rehearsal. Yet, that is exactly what we expect to occur in our organizations. We expect people to learn when the costs of failure are high, when personal threat is great, when there is no opportunity to “replay” an important decision, and when there is no way to simplify complexity and shorten time delays so as to better understand the consequences of actions.

a common form of reengineering is to “co-locate” all the engineers of a large product development effort into one site, to alleviate traditional organizational “stovepipes” separating engineering subspecialties. But in itself, this “co-location” often fails to get at the real barriers to cross-functional problem solving—which are in people’s heads, not within the organizational structure. Solutions to cross-functional barriers tend to emerge only when the newly “co-located” engineers can develop openness and systems thinking skills, and discover how their individual ways of working might unintentionally sabotage the development of the product as a whole.

Without a well-articulated theory and set of tools, most reengineering efforts are driven instead by vague concerns to eliminate redundancy or reduce costs. Even if such early efforts are successful, they do not build an organization’s capability to continually reengineer itself. Often, the organizations become dependent on expert reengineering consultants.

implementing systemic insights may require that diverse organizational interests cooperate in pursuing policies that might be suboptimal for individual functional areas. But such behavior can seemingly contradict traditions of functional excellence. Unless commitment to the mission and vision of the larger organization is greater than commitment to individual functional goals, functional goals will predominate.

many of the most important results of organizational learning are not quantifiable: intelligence, openness, innovativeness, high moral quality, courage, confidence, genuine caring—for the customer, for one another, and for our shared aspirations. Despite the nonquantifiable nature of such results, they are not unknowable.

Yet, in the West, the concept of measure has come to mean “comparison to some fixed external unit,” while maya means “illusion.”

Developing a field that encourages learning is the primary task of leadership, and perhaps the only way that a leader can genuinely influence or inspire others. To build a field, you don’t look first to bringing other people on board; you attend to the appropriate details within your sphere, and people eventually come on board themselves.

The word “intimacy” stems from the Latin intimatus, to make something known to someone else. (Another derivation is the verb “intimate,” which originally meant “to notify.”) In its original meaning, in other words, intimacy did not mean emotional closeness, but the willingness to pass on honest information.—CR

Intimacy in organizations starts with a commitment to get to know people behind the mask of their job title, role, or function. Members of an intimate team know each others’ preferences and predilections. They speak openly about what they believe, feel, think, and aspire to be. They are skilled at balancing inquiry and advocacy; this skill appears to be far easier to learn and practice when there is a threshold level of intimacy.

Like the word “author,” this word can be traced back to the Greek authentikós, which meant “do-er,” master, or creator.

The term mastery descends from the Sanskrit root mah, meaning “greater.” (This is also the source of “maharajah.”) Through the centuries, in Latin and Old English, the meaning of “mastery” as domination over something else (“I am your master”) has endured. But a variation of the word evolved in medieval French: maître, meaning someone who was exceptionally proficient and skilled—a master of a craft.

THE CENTRAL PRACTICE OF PERSONAL MASTERY INVOLVES LEARNING TO keep both a personal vision and a clear picture of current reality before us. Doing this will generate a force within ourselves called “creative tension.” Tension, by its nature, seeks resolution, and the most natural resolution of this tension is for our reality to move closer to what we want.

Personal mastery teaches us not to lower our vision, even if it seems as if the vision is impossible. And, paradoxically, it teaches us that the content of the vision is not important in itself. “It’s not what the vision is,” says Robert Fritz. “It’s what the vision does.”

Personal mastery also teaches not to shrink back from seeing the world as it is, even if it makes us uncomfortable.

Practicing personal mastery is like holding a conversation within ourselves. One voice within us dreams of what we want for the future. Still another casts an (often baleful) eye on the world around us. A third voice, often well hidden, is willing to say, “I have chosen what I want and accepted that I will create it.” In this discipline, we try to hear all these facets clearly, knowing that the power which pulls us toward our vision emerges from the relationship between them.

Making choices and looking closely at current reality can also bring deeply buried emotions to the surface. It may depress people at first: “I didn’t want to see how much I dislike my life currently, and I don’t want the burden of trying to improve it.” It will also probably energize people: “I always thought the world did it to me. Now I realize I’m pulling my own strings.” None of these emotions are bad in themselves; but as they come to the surface, people should be prepared for them.

A vision exists within each of us, even if we have not made it explicit or put it into words.

Values are deeply held views, of what we find worthwhile. They come from many sources: parents, religion, schools, peers, people we admire, and culture. Many go back to childhood; we take on others as adults. As with all mental models, there’s a distinction between our “espoused” values—which we profess to believe in—and our “values in action,” which actually guide our behavior. These latter values are coded into our brains at such a fundamental level that we can’t easily see them. We rarely bring them to the surface or question them. That’s why they create dissonance for us.

Because creative tension depends on a clear understanding of current reality, it drains away as soon as people lie to themselves or each other. Why, then, is it so difficult for people in organizations to tell the truth? Why is it especially difficult when the truth helps—when it empowers us to take corrective actions or make choices in favor of what we truly want? The answer stems from conflicts between honesty and loyalty.

Pause and ask yourself: 1. What is happening right now? Stretch it out by asking yourself three subsidiary questions: What am I doing right now? What am I feeling right now? What am I thinking right now? Then ask a second primary question: 2. What do I want right now? In other words, ask yourself what you are trying to achieve in this conversation. Often, simply the act of asking this question will provoke a change, without your making a deliberate decision to change. This can lead you to a third question: 3. What am I doing right now to prevent myself from getting what I want? Make a choice at this moment. All you need to do is to say the phrase to yourself, “I choose …” And finally, 4.

Traditional personal mastery practice is centered around a shift in people’s view of their relationship to the world. In Robert Fritz’s terms, it’s a shift from being “reactive” (responding to events), to “creative” (creating the future you want). I now believe that, as people practice personal mastery, they can begin to pass into a third orientation: “interdependent,” in which you and the world are intimately interrelated.

As you work with personal vision and current reality, reflect on the orientation from which you perceive them. When do you view the world reactively? When creatively? When interdependently? Which of these orientations do you choose, for which aspects of your life? Seeing the orientations more clearly will help you see the sources of both your fears and aspirations.

Managers in Western corporations have received a lifetime of training in being forceful, articulate “advocates” and “problem solvers.” They know how to present and argue strongly for their views. But as people rise in the organization, they are forced to deal with more complex and interdependent issues where no one individual “knows the answer,” and where the only viable option is for groups of informed and committed individuals to think together to arrive at new insights. At this point, they need to learn to skillfully balance advocacy with inquiry.

When balancing advocacy and inquiry, we lay out our reasoning and thinking, and then encourage others to challenge us. “Here is my view and here is how I have arrived at it. How does it sound to you? What makes sense to you and what doesn’t? Do you see any ways I can improve it?” Balancing inquiry and advocacy is sometimes hard on people’s cherished opinions, which is one reason why it is so difficult to master. But the payoff comes in the more creative and insightful realizations that occur when people combine multiple perspectives.

There are dysfunctional forms of both advocacy and inquiry. For example, in organizations, adroit people can skew the inquiry process by relentless “interrogating,” without caring at all for the person being questioned. In the same vein, advocacy can feel like an inquisition if the advocate simply “dictates” his point of view, while refusing to make his reasoning process visible.

They did not recognize or discuss this lack of agreement; instead, they engaged in fancy footwork to avoid facing it, which only heightened the severity of their dilemmas. As more people get involved, these interpersonal dynamics escalate into “secondary inhibiting loops”—coalitions, group-think, and committees which spend their time second-guessing and outmaneuvering each other.

Interventionists trying to change organizations may already possess skills such as “balancing advocacy with inquiry” and “left-hand column” analysis. But the interventionist must also set an example: avoiding any form of coercion or unilateral control of participants, even under the guise that it is in the participants’ best interest to be coerced. There’s a paradox here—how do you bring about free and informed consent, without controlling the group, when participants* automatic (defensive) behavior may block their chances for free and informed consent?

The purpose of most memos and reports is not to promote learning, or even to communicate, but to select a version of the truth to present for “the record”—for your boss, for the outside world, or for posterity. This puts writers within learning organizations in a difficult bind. Should they write the truth as the organization needs to hear it, or should they write what is politically expected of them? Fortunately, it also means that writing, if approached correctly, can be a very effective solo vehicle for surfacing mental models.

Our third key value, localness, did not represent a geographic concept. It was based on the principle of subsidiarity: that a higher level should not make decisions for a lower level, if the lower level is capable of making the decision itself.

I first heard the phrase “destiny factor” used by a Jungian psychotherapist. She said it helped her keep from inadvertently imposing her own opinions about what her clients should do. She began with the premise that each of her clients had his or her own unique “calling,” which he or she was placed here to accomplish. To tamper with this destiny, she said, or to give advice without calling attention to it, was dangerous and manipulative. Her job was to help people intuit their purpose for themselves, and then help them move into alignment with that purpose.

ANYONE DOING SERIOUS WORK IN TEAM LEARNING SHOULD BE FAMILIAR with the key reflection-and-inquiry skills of the mental models discipline: balancing advocacy with inquiry, seeking to bring the tacit assumptions of the left-hand column to the surface, and becoming aware of the assumptions and beliefs that link “what we see” to “what we conclude.”

The word “discussion” stems from the Latin discutere, which meant “to smash to pieces.” Discussion is a conversational form that promotes fragmentation. However, skillful discussion* differs from unproductive discussion because the participants are not merely engaged in “advocacy wars” of one-upmanship.

As Bohm has suggested, fragmentation of thought is like a virus that has infected every field of human endeavor. Specialists in most fields cannot talk across specialties. Marketing sees production as the problem. Managers are told to “think” while workers are told to “act.” Instead of reasoning together, people defend their “part,” seeking to defeat others.

traditional discussion is dangerously oriented toward advocacy. People “discuss” to win; they heave ideas against each other, as Bill Isaacs puts it, to see whose ideas will be the strongest. It is a dismal way to conduct teamwork, not just because it undermines learning, but because ideas and “solutions” rarely get the consideration they deserve. They are judged according to who said them, and whether or not they match conventional wisdom.

Other teams pride themselves on how constructively they deal with confrontation. My experience, however, is that they just sit there and listen, in turn, to each other’s position statements.

In most teams, the discussion moves at such a fast clip, and people use words so loosely, that it becomes very hard to build shared meaning.

A “Shifting the Burden” story, like a “Fixes That Backfire” situation, usually begins with a problem symptom that prompts someone to intervene and “solve” it. The solution (or solutions) are obvious and immediate; they relieve the problem symptom quickly. But they divert attention away from the real or fundamental source of the problem, which becomes weaker as less attention is paid to it. This reinforces the perception that there is no other way out except the symptomatic solution.

Would any reorganization of human relationships be required for this fundamental solution? Could anything be done to make the necessary shift of orientation easier for the people involved?

Simon’s “principle of bounded rationality” presents us with a dilemma. The only system maps we can interpret correctly will be trivial and incomplete compared to the complexity of the systems we seek to understand. Alternatively, we can create more complex and realistic maps of our systems, but our intuition is then insufficient to provide guidance into their dynamics or help us find high-leverage policies. One resolution of the dilemma is the use of computer simulation. Computer-based models accurately calculate the consequences of the assumptions in our system maps, no matter how complex.

Analysts at division quality offices combined the separate data from local processes to obtain averages for each plant and then aggregated them into divisionwide reports. Now the division managers could use quality numbers in the same manner they traditionally used financial numbers to compare plants (their own and supplier plants). If the “score” was too low one quarter, the plant manager had to explain why. The game in each plant changed from improvement to making the plant look good against its neighbors. Because the figures were used to compare plants, people became fearful that the numbers might be used to punish them.

Why would talking about a traumatic experience have almost no effect, but writing about it yield such significant benefits? From a psychological perspective, talking and writing are very different. Talking can often be somewhat unstructured, disorganized, even chaotic. In contrast, writing encourages the creation of a story line and structure that help people make sense of what has happened and work towards a solution. In short, talking can add to a sense of confusion while writing provides a more systematic, and solution-based, approach.

High-performing teamwork is a characteristic that emerges when the conditions are just right, when the team really is behaving as a team. This is merely one example of emergence, whereby the whole does indeed become greater than the sum of its parts.

A bicycle cannot balance by itself, nor can the system of a bicycle and its rider when stationary. But when the system becomes dynamic, when the rider pumps energy into the system to make the bicycle move forwards, then suddenly the bicycle and the rider can stay upright, without wobbling. Dynamic systems can therefore exhibit stable structures without explicit external intervention.

The flow of information within a system is known as feedback, which is a much broader use of the term as compared to feedback in connection with personal counseling, for example. The action of feedback, however, is not exclusively to control, to limit, or to constrain; sometimes, feedback operates to exaggerate or to amplify, an example being the way in which crowds—and indeed stock markets—can, under certain circumstances, become increasingly frenzied or panicked.

a good architecture has a partitioning scheme that puts things that are likely to change together into the same subsystem (high cohesiveness) and insulates subsystems from changes in other subsystems (loose coupling). Over time it has become abundantly clear that change is easiest and least expensive when these rules are followed; a good architecture is necessarily low-dependency.

We have often found companies trying to employ agile practices to maintain a monolithic code base with massive interdependencies, but we have rarely seen this work well. Why? In agile development, change is encouraged rather than avoided. But with a tightly coupled architecture, change is both risky and expensive. Thus, attempting agile development in a large system with a tightly coupled architecture creates a dissonance that cannot be easily reconciled.

If you are struggling with a tightly coupled architecture, take a leaf out of the Internet playbook and work to pay off this technical debt.34 However, do not spend large amounts of time defining a new architecture in great detail; after all, the underlying architecture of the Internet can be expressed in four well thought-out rules. If you spend a lot of time developing an architectural framework, the world will pass you by long before it’s implemented. Settle on a solid, low-dependency technical vision and evolve in that direction.

There are traditionally two uses of a software specification: Developers write code to meet the specification, and testers create various types of tests and write test scripts to assure that the code meets the specification. The problem is, the two groups usually work separately, and worse, the testers don’t write the tests until after the code is written. Under this scenario, the developers invariably interpret the details of the specification somewhat differently than the testers, so the code and tests do not match. Well after the code is written, the tests are run and these discrepancies are discovered. This is not a mistake-proofing process; this is a defect-injection process

If this sounds easy, rest assured that it is not. Deciding what to automate, writing good tests, automating them, running them at the right time, and maintaining them is every bit as challenging as writing good code. It requires a good test architecture, sensible choices as to what to include in various test suites, and ongoing updating of tests so that they always match the current code.

Performance, load, scalability, security, resilience, stability, reliability, compatibility, interoperability, maintainability—these are various aspects of stress testing that should be done as appropriate in your world. Generally you want to push your system over a cliff during this testing so that you know where the cliff is, and then stay away from that cliff in normal operation.

Where did we get the idea that we should wait until the end of development to put the pieces of the system together?

Denning and his colleagues talk about two kinds of evolution. First there is the evolution of a system as it goes through a series of releases. This can work, they say, as long as the releases are close together. When releases stretch out beyond the environment change time, this strategy does not work. A second kind of evolution occurs when multiple systems that compete with each other are created and only the fittest survive.

Evolutionary development is the preferred approach for reducing risk, because it confronts risk rather than avoiding it.

Ethnography is about focusing on what works and what doesn’t. And it’s about constantly asking why? Why do people behave the way they do? Why are they annoyed by the way things work? Why are products and services designed the way they are? Why are they difficult (or easy) to use? It pays to observe outliers—people who don’t follow the rules and use a product in an unusual way, people who either love or hate a product and aren’t afraid to talk about why.

The biggest cause of failure in software-intensive systems is not technical failure; it’s building the wrong thing. We know this. Study after study confirms it. And yet we continue to put intermediaries between the development team and its customers. We might call these intermediaries systems analysts or product owners, but all too often they represent a handover of information. Secondhand information about the problem to be solved handicaps the people making the detailed decisions about how the system will behave. A critical role for product managers and product owners is to build bridges between customers and development team members, so they can talk to each other.

In the book The Elegant Solution,53 Matthew May says that one of the 12 practices of great innovators is to think in pictures. This is very useful in software development, because software is invisible to anyone who doesn’t read the code. By making mental models visible with pictures, diagrams, charts, and so on, the development team members can more easily communicate with one another, with customers, and with others who are interested in their work.

What do competency leaders actually do? First and foremost, they are committed to developing excellent technology in their organization. They begin by framing good software development in terms of an enabling architecture, mistake-proofed processes, evolutionary development, and technical expertise. They ensure that a low-dependency architecture is in place. They make sure that test-driven development and continuous integration are used effectively. They provide for cycles of learning with iterative development and set-based design, and they advise when each is appropriate. They set standards, insist on code clarity, and make sure code reviews are focused on enhancing learning.

Most schedule coupling that we see in software development does not come from the architectural dependencies; it is the direct result of trying to achieve a high utilization of people. It seems that many companies don’t ever want to see idle workers, so they use scheduling systems to enable them to fully use workers’ available time. This creates tight coupling of multiple schedules and invariably leads to cascading delays. The inevitable delays decrease utilization to a far lower point than what can be achieved with a decoupled scheduling system.

In order for work to flow, it is very important to limit the amount of work to capacity; do not try to force more work through your development organization than it has the capacity to deliver. Trying to force a system to work beyond its capacity invariably causes turbulence and slows things down. It is rather difficult to limit work to capacity, however, if you do not know what your capacity is. Whether you use iterations or kanban, it is important to generate a useful measurement of your capacity, so you know how much work your system is capable of handling.

Push systems are managed by “pushing” a predetermined plan to the operating environment and tracking task completion against that plan. Since the plan is fixed in advance, a push system is ill equipped to handle variety or variation. And since all work has variation—the more complexity and change, the more variation—it is impossible to follow a detailed plan exactly unless it has enough slack to absorb the variation.

Pull systems are managed by managing the queue of things that should happen next; when people want to know what to do next, they pull an item off the top of a queue. Since these queues can be changed dynamically, pull systems are naturally capable of handling variety and variation. Therefore, it is not really necessary to add slack to absorb variation, because the system creates the necessary slack when necessary—and only when necessary.

Decoupling also applies to teams; teams work better if they can operate independently, without significant dependencies on other teams. We recommend using feature teams,23 that is, relatively small, long-lived, cross-functional teams that complete end-to-end customer features. Feature teams stay together over time, moving features through the workflow as a team, accepting new features when others are finished. The ability of feature teams to act independently is related to the dependencies in your architecture, so we reemphasize the need for low-dependency architectures.

The initial value estimate for a request need only be accurate enough to compare it to other opportunities.

We recommend that you do not start out by breaking down the work into detailed tasks, getting estimates on each task, and then laying out the tasks in a schedule. Why? The tasks have probably not been vetted; you are not sure they are what the customers really need, or what other parts of the system will actually require. And since this is a large system, you can be sure that it will be complex and will take a long time to develop.

As you will discover, these superimpositions often do not sound well when played abruptly and by themselves. Find ways to approach these notes from simpler chord notes in such a way that the added ninths, elevenths, or thirteenths are related to something in its proximity which is consonant.

If we extract the ninth, augmented eleventh, and thirteenth from a C chord, we have the notes D, F#, and A, which spell a D major triad. Therefore, if we want to add a major ninth, augmented eleventh, and thirteenth to any chord, we simply add a major triad whose root is a major second (one whole step) above the octave of the chord’s root. Now we are no longer thinking in terms of superimpositions of ninths, elevenths, and thirteenths, but are involved instead with polychordalism, which is the simultaneous playing of two (or more) different chords. In this case we have a D major triad over a C seventh chord.

The only thing left of a tune after it has really been worked over in modern jazz is the general functional structure—in very broad terms, too. The exact root progression is usually gone; the melody is gone, but the number of bars in the tune remains the same, and you generally reach the tonic, dominant, or subdominant in the same measures as they occur in the original version of the tune. All substitutions, fake cadences, or tricks cannot obscure the recognizability of that structure.

The endless variety of chords is better thought of as being controlled by questions of density, or sonority, or spacing, and not harmony in the sense of voice-leading. Example: I place my hands on the keyboard at random, making sure that the lowest note I strike is functionally useful, but the other fingers are spaced in thirds or fourths for sonority, or in seconds for bite. My harmony is limited to the function of the lowest note, and maybe a fifth or a seventh above that, and the rest of the notes are color …

During the Middle Ages, a traveller once came upon a place in France where a great deal of building work was going on. He began talking with the stone cutters and asking them about their work. He approached the first worker and asked, ‘What are you doing?’ The man, very disgruntled, and obviously unhappy in his hard toil, replied, ‘I’m cutting these huge boulders with the simplest of tools and putting them together in the way I’ve been told to do. I’m sweating in this heat and my back is hurting. What’s more, I’m totally bored, and I wish I didn’t have to do this hard and meaningless job.’ The traveller moved on quickly to interview a second worker. He asked the same question: ‘What are you doing?’ The worker replied, ‘Well, I have a wife and children at home, so I come here every morning and I work these boulders into regular shapes, as I’m told to do. It gets repetitive sometimes, but it helps to feed my family, and that’s all I want.’ Somewhat encouraged, the traveller went on to a third worker. ‘And what are you doing?’ he asked. The third worker responded with shining eyes, as he pointed up to the heavens, ‘I’m building a cathedral!’

From almost the dawn of agriculture, peasants had tilled their land with nothing more than a metal-tipped wooden spike, perhaps pulled by an ox, that gouged a furrow out of the ground. Then, in the tenth century AD, another method of tilling the soil arrived in England from the continent.5 A team of eight oxen, yoked two abreast and pulling a heavy iron plough, now worked the fields of Otham. The new machine had a blade that cut into the earth; a ploughshare that dug in at right angles and a mouldboard behind that actually turned the soil over as it went. This had many beneficial effects. Turning over the soil buried any weeds growing in the field so that they died and improved the soil’s fertility. It also increased the amount of water that the ground could hold. Finally, it was much more efficient to operate than the old scratch plough because it attacked a larger cross-section of soil.

Farmers had long been aware of the importance of rotating their crops – allowing some fields to lie fallow as pasture while varying the crops planted in others. This idea advanced further in the early Middle Ages when three-field rotation began to appear. Under this system, the fields of Otham were split into three groups. The first group lay fallow as pasture for the villagers’ animals, especially the team of plough oxen whose manure added to the richness of the field. The villagers planted the second group in the autumn with grain as they had done since time immemorial. However, they also planted beans in the spring in the third group of fields, which further improved the soil and provided a broader diet.10 Beans, we now know, take nitrogen out of the air and bacteria in their roots turn it into natural fertiliser.

One of the most distinctive features of the Byzantine Empire, as opposed to the old Roman Empire, was that the Byzantines were predominantly Greeks. Although they continued to call themselves Romans, the use of Latin died out and Greek became the dominant language. In the ruins of the western half of the Empire, knowledge of Greek practically ceased to exist when the barbarian tribes took over or destroyed the Roman infrastructure. Previously, the best-educated Romans would have been fluent in Greek as well as their native Latin. On the other hand, the barbarians all spoke their own tongues and although Latin did survive as the language of the Church, a linguistic divide opened up between East and West. This was doubly unfortunate because, in the ancient world, it was Greek and not Latin that was the language of scholarship and philosophy. Suddenly, the West lost access to this tradition.

Charlemagne is significant partly because he was a strong ruler who was able to control enough resources to fund a cultural revival, usually called the ‘Carolingian Renaissance’. Charlemagne himself was barely literate but he appointed the celebrated scholar Alcuin of York (c.735–804) to help foster learning in his capital and at other centres in his enormous Empire. Today we still have reason to be grateful for these efforts, as many works of classical Latin literature have come down to us because of them.

The way we imagine our universe and ourselves is often deep-seated, almost unconscious, and we rarely think about it. We find it hard to imagine that the world could function in any other way and feel that the ideas we have learned to believe are, in some sense, self-evident.

The modern secular western ‘worldview’ is naturalistic. We believe that nature blindly follows laws that we can describe using mathematics; and that we live in an impersonal universe that is unimaginably old and vast, on a planet orbiting an ordinary star. We also assume the laws of physics that apply to us also apply to the rest of the universe. Almost nobody asks why gravity actually works and we regard it as inconceivable that it should cease to do so. The only way that we can enjoy reliable knowledge is through science, which works because the laws of nature never change.

Medieval people also believed that the world worked in a completely reasonable way; it just wasn’t the same way that we think it works. The central idea of the medieval worldview was that everything and everybody had a purpose. Nothing just happened. Nothing existed purely for its own sake. The ultimate governor of the universe was God and he had endowed everything with a reason for its existence.

Another modern misconception about the medieval Christian worldview is that people thought the central position of the earth meant that it was somehow exalted. In fact, to the medieval mind, the reverse was the case. The universe was a hierarchy and the further from the earth you travelled, the closer to Heaven you came.

What made Plato so conducive to Christianity was that he emphasised the intellectual and spiritual aspects of life over the material. For Plato, the ultimate reality was not the everyday physical world, but a transcendent realm of ideas. He called these ideas ‘Forms’ and claimed that they were the templates from which our world had been constructed by a divine creator from pre-existing matter. Thus, the material world was simply a shadow of the perfect reality of the Forms.

the ‘ontological argument’, is one of the classic conundrums of philosophy. It goes something like this: We have the conception of God in our minds as the being greater than any other thing of which we can conceive. However, in order for God to be truly the greatest thing that we can conceive, he would also have to exist, because if he did not then he would not be the greatest. A real greatest thing is certainly greater than an imaginary one. Thus, if God did not exist, he would not be the greatest thing we can conceive and hence he must exist.3

Medieval logic was mainly concerned with how things are described and to what extent those descriptions are real. Here is a frivolous example; in the village of Otham today, you will often spy white fluffy animals gambolling in a field. We call them ‘sheep’. But can we say that the concept of ‘sheep’ really exists, or should we just say that there are individual creatures that we collectively call by that name? In other words, is there such a thing as ‘sheepness’ or are there just a lot of sheep?

Merely being white, fluffy and gambolling does not make an animal ovine. A crippled, freshly sheared black sheep would nonetheless be a sheep. On the other hand, it is impossible to be a sheep and not to be an animal. Thus, using the Aristotelian definition of substance and accident, we could say being white, fluffy and gambolling are accidental properties of a sheep. On the other hand, being an animal is a substantial property. It is possible to change the accidental properties of an object without it thereby losing its essential substance. On the other hand, any change in its substantial properties would alter its very essence and make it an entirely different kind of object.6

Abelard’s most famous work, intended primarily as a textbook for his students, is called Yes and No. It contains little more than a host of quotations from the Church fathers arranged in such a way as to make it clear where they were contradicting each other. The aim was not to prove that they actually were contradictory, but rather to aid his students in resolving these perceived problems. Abelard wrote in the preface of Yes and No: ‘By doubting we come to inquiry and by inquiry we see the truth.’19 He meant that we can discover the truth, but only through a sceptical method of asking difficult questions. The main criticism of the book made by his opponents was that it made no effort to resolve these contradictions, and thus gave the impression (which we might not think so misleading) that they were real.

Speaking through Timaeus, Plato tells us that a divine creator made the world out of some sort of pre-existing chaos. Because the chaos was difficult to shape, the universe that resulted was not as perfect as the original Forms on which the creator had based his design. The creator also gave the universe a soul, which is the active force that keeps the heavens moving. Various inferior gods govern the day-to-day workings of the universe and the creator delegated to them the job of fashioning animals, including man. Man thus finds himself in the middle of a great celestial hierarchy. The creator god is at the top with other gods below, while mankind is in the middle and brute animals lie beneath him.

It has been suggested that religious people who see God as intervening in the world cannot do science because they believe everything that happens is God’s will. In other words, they are unable to distinguish between something that is a result of the laws of science and something that occurs due to the direct actions of God. A good example is the question of what a Christian should do if she becomes ill. Is sickness a divine punishment for some sin that has been committed? Alternatively, is it just a natural phenomenon best understood in terms of the physical spread of disease? In short, is it better to visit a priest or a doctor? Actually, most medieval people would tend to hedge their bets and follow both religious and medical advice. The former was especially popular during the plague and against other diseases for which there was no cure.

From the early twelfth century onwards, western scholars translated a vast corpus of Greek and Arabic learning into Latin. Once recovered, these works quickly came to dominate learning throughout Catholic Europe. The translation movement occurred because western Christians knew that they were missing out on a great deal of knowledge that was already available to Muslims and Byzantines. They spoke of the ‘poverty of the Latins’ because only the most basic material was available in their language. To remedy this they set out to acquire the riches that they knew existed in other cultures.

The world’s first true university was the law school in Bologna. The Holy Roman Emperor Frederick Barbarossa (1123–90) granted it an imperial privilege in 1158 when he allowed the students to govern themselves.24 An exodus of these students, unhappy with their treatment by the town council of Bologna, led to the foundation of the university of Padua in 1222.25 The university of Paris grew out of the cathedral schools where Peter Abelard had taught, gaining royal recognition from the king of France in 1200.26 During the thirteenth century, the masters of Paris were sometimes on strike for years at a time, but such was the university’s importance and prestige that they almost always got their own way in the end. Mystery surrounds the origins of Oxford, but it first appears in the records during the early thirteenth century.

Many people say that one of the signs of geniuses in a field is the ability to see problems and challenges and ask questions that no one else sees or asks. So first find and frame the creative challenge.  Second, immerse yourself, dig deep. Gather ideas, data, information, anything that's going to help you with a creative breakthrough.  The third phase is a little counter-intuitive for some people: let it all go. Just relax. The best ideas come while you're taking a long hot shower, going for a walk, or on vacation10. Here, the self-mastery comes in knowing when to let go, and knowing that you need to let go.  The final stage, the fourth, is execution – and, of course, many brilliant ideas fail here, because they aren't implemented well.  This model is accurate to a point – but life is not that simple.

Brain studies on creativity reveal what goes on at that “Aha!” moment, when we get a sudden insight. If you measure EEG brain waves during a creative moment, it turns out there is very high gamma activity that spikes 300 milliseconds before the answer comes to us. Gamma activity indicates the binding together of neurons, as far-flung brain cells connect in a new neural network – as when a new association emerges. Immediately after that gamma spike, the new idea enters our consciousness.

The relationship of stress to performance, captured in the Yerkes-Dodson Law, shows that boredom and disengagement trigger too little of the stress hormones secreted by the HPA axis – and performance lags.

If the challenges get too great and we become overwhelmed, we go into the zone of burnout, where stress hormone levels get too high and hamper performance.

Challenges – like getting motivated to reach a goal, or being called on to exhibit your best skills, or a team’s race to meet a deadline – focus our attention and elicit our best efforts on the job at hand.

An early brain study suggested that while people are in flow, only those brain areas relevant to the activity at hand are activated. This contrasts with the brain of a person who is bored; then you see randomly scattered neural activation, rather than a sharp delineation of activity in the areas relevant to the task. In the brain of a person who is stressed, you find lots of activity in the emotional circuitry which is irrelevant to the task at hand, and which suggests an anxious distractedness.

There are several pathways to flow:  •Adjust demands to fit the person’s skills. If you manage people’s work, try to gauge their optimal level of challenge. If they're under-engaged, increase the challenge in ways that make their work more interesting – for instance by giving a stretch assignment. If they are overwhelmed, reduce the demand and give them more support (whether emotional or logistic)  •Practice the relevant expertise to raise skills to meet a higher level of demand  •Enhance concentration abilities so you can pay more attention, because attention itself is a pathway into the flow stage.

take a study where people were given performance feedback – some negative, some positive. If they were given negative performance feedback in a very warm, positive, and upbeat tone, they came out of there feeling pretty good about the interaction. If they were given positive feedback in a very cold, critical, judgmental tone, they came out feeling negative, even about positive feedback. So the emotional subtext is more powerful in many ways than the overt, ostensible interaction that we're having.

Who sends the emotions that pass between people, and who receives them? One answer, for groups of peers, is that the sender tends to be the most emotionally expressive person in the group. But in groups where there are power differences – in the classroom, at work, in organizations generally – it is the most powerful person who is the emotional sender, setting the emotional state for the rest of the group.

In any human group, people pay most attention to – and put most importance on – what the most powerful person in that group says or does. There are many studies that show, for example, that if the leader of a team is in a positive mood, that spreads an upbeat mood to the others and that collective positivity enhances the group’s performance. If the leader projects a negative mood, that spreads in the same way, and the group’s performance suffers. This has been found for groups making business decisions, seeking creative solutions – even erecting a tent together.

There are three ingredients to rapport24. The first is paying full attention. Both people need to tune in fully to the other, putting aside distractions. The second is being in synch non-verbally. If two people are really connecting well, and you were to observe that interaction without paying attention to what they were saying (like watching a film with no soundtrack), you'll see their moves are almost choreographed, like a dance. Such synchrony is orchestrated by another set of neurons, called oscillators, which regulate how our body moves in relationship to another body (or any object)25. The third ingredient of rapport is positive feeling.

When your physiology is in synchrony with someone else you feel connected, close and warm. You can read this human moment in terms of physiology – but you can also read it experientially, because during those moments of chemistry we feel good about being with the other person.

The neural dynamic behind flaming is that the social brain has no feedback loop online: unless you are in a live, face-to-face teleconference, the social circuitry has no input. It doesn't know how the other person is reacting so it can't guide our response – do this, don't do that – as it does automatically and instantly in face-to-face interactions. Instead of acting as a social radar, the social brain says nothing – and that unleashes the amygdala to flame if we’re having a hijack.

There are three kinds of empathy. One is cognitive empathy: I know how you see things; I can take your perspective. Managers high in this kind of empathy are able to get better than expected performance from employees, because they can put things in terms that people can understand – and that motivates them. And executives higher in cognitive empathy do better in foreign postings, because they pick up the unspoken norms of a different culture more quickly.

when a chimp sees another chimp in distress – either from an injury or a loss of social status – the first chimp mimics the behavior of the distressed chimp, a primal form of empathy. Many chimps will then go over and give some solace to the upset chimp, for example, stroking it to help it calm down. Female chimps offer this kind of solace more often than male chimps do – with one intriguing exception: the alpha males, who are the troupe leaders, give solace even more often than do female chimps. One of the basic functions of a leader, it seems, is to offer appropriate emotional support.

The bishop formed a local synod of his colleagues who issued the formal excommunication of Amaury and his followers. The decree went on to ban the books assumed to have inspired the heresy. ‘Neither the works of Aristotle on natural philosophy’, it read, ‘nor their commentaries are to be read at Paris in public or private. This we forbid under penalty of excommunication.’5 Aristotle, the bishops thought, was the original source of many of Amaury’s ideas. It is no use wondering what exactly the synod found objectionable in the books that they banned because, almost certainly, they had not read them.

Both Aristotle and Christian thinkers accepted that there are fixed natural laws, but the Greek philosopher went further. For Aristotle, the iron shackles of logical necessity determined what the laws of nature had to be.6 They were not just the ones upon which God had deliberately decided, they were the only ones he could have used. Even if God had actually created the world, he would have had no choice about how it turned out.7 It was as if he had to follow a pre-existing recipe and, unless he followed it precisely, the result would be a mess.

The largest heretical sect was the Cathars. They seem to have originated in eastern Europe and may have been a descendant of an early offshoot of Christianity called Manichaeism. Both the Cathars and the Manichaeans believed that there were two gods, one good and one evil. There was disagreement over whether the two gods were equally powerful, but the evil one created and ruled the material world. This meant that matter itself was evil and mankind should try to escape it by concentrating wholly on the spiritual.15 The most committed Cathars, called the perfecti, were strict ascetics who abstained from eating meat and having sex. They hoped that by their refusal to countenance material things they might be able to free themselves from the shackles of the flesh. They were strongest in southern France around Toulouse, where they enjoyed considerable influence and the protection of the nobility.

According to the conventional rules of management in the current information age, leaders manage people. They recruit the best talent, provide appropriate incentives, give stretch assignments to develop talent, use emotional intelligence to connect with each individual, review performance carefully, and retain those who clear the bar. As important as these activities are, relying exclusively on them means relying on the flawed assumption that individual performance depends solely on something inherent in the employee. Management guru Jim Collins advises that it’s crucial to get “the right people on the bus.”6 Many managers leap to the temptingly simplistic conclusion that doing so is their most important job. Unfortunately, the conventional rules miss the fundamental act of good management: managing for progress.

When something unexpected or ambiguous happens, people will try to understand it and will draw conclusions about the work, their colleagues, and the organization based on that event. In this way, a single incident can continue to reverberate and impact people and their work long after the triggering event itself is over.

Individual performance is closely tied to inner work life. If people do not perceive that they and their work are valued by a trustworthy organization, if they derive no pride or happiness from their work, they will have little drive to dig into a project. And without a strong drive to deeply engage the problems and opportunities of a project, people are unlikely to do their best work.

Motivation is a person’s grasp of what needs to be done and his or her drive to do it at any given moment. More precisely, motivation is a combination of a person’s choice to do some task, desire to expend effort at doing it, and drive to persist with that effort.

Despite the Star Trek premise that Mr. Spock’s purely rational, emotionless thought processes led to better decision making, in fact the opposite is true—at least for humans. Research on patients suffering damage to emotion centers in the brain reveals decision-making impairment even though they are quite normal cognitively. They can make complex calculations, understand language, and read and write, but they can have great difficulty deciding between even simple alternatives like taking a taxi or a bus.18 They cannot decide which option is better, because all choices seem equally good. Without the emotion of fear, for example, they find it impossible to weigh the risks of one choice over another. Similarly, if they cannot feel joy in their accomplishments, they have little intrinsic drive to work. In either case, their motivation for taking action stalls.

To be meaningful, your work doesn’t have to have profound importance to society—organizing all of the world’s information, caring for the sick, alleviating poverty, or helping to cure cancer. What matters is whether you perceive your work as contributing value to something or someone who matters

Most jobs in modern organizations are potentially meaningful for the people doing them. However, managers should make sure that employees know just how their work is contributing. And, most importantly, managers should avoid actions that negate the value of the work.

All the participants in our research were doing work that should have been meaningful. Shockingly often, however, we saw potentially important, challenging work drained of its meaning. When we probed the journal entries to see just how this happened, we discerned four mechanisms. First is what Richard experienced: having one’s work or ideas dismissed by leaders or coworkers. Second is losing a sense of ownership in one’s work.

A third reliable way to kill meaning is to make employees doubt that the work they are doing will ever see the light of day. This can happen because management priorities shift or because managers simply change their ideas about how something should be done.

We all need to believe that our labor is actually contributing to something that matters. When that belief stays firm, progress leads to real satisfaction, strong motivation to continue the work, and positive feelings. When our work is devoid of meaning, then even completing a long list of tasks cannot yield a genuine sense of accomplishment.

Consistent daily progress by individual employees fuels both the success of the organization and the quality of those employees’ inner work lives.22 To harness this powerful force, you must ensure that consistent forward movement in meaningful work is a regular occurrence in your employees’ daily work lives, despite the inevitable setbacks that all nontrivial work entails.

Setting clear goals.2 People have better inner work lives when they know where their work is heading and why it matters. Unambiguous short- and long-term goals give teams tangible mileposts that render their progress salient. When people have conflicting priorities or unclear, meaningless, or arbitrarily shifting goals, they become frustrated, cynical, and demotivated. Time is wasted as people spin their wheels, and the work suffers.

Allowing autonomy.3 Setting clear goals can backfire if it amounts to nothing more than telling people what to do and how to do it. To be truly intrinsically motivated and to gain a sense of self-efficacy when they do make progress, people need to have some say in their own work. What’s more, when employees have freedom in how to do the work, they are more creative.

Learning from problems and successes.8 No matter how skilled people are, or how well designed and well executed their projects, problems and failures are inevitable in complex, creative work. We found that inner work life was much more positive when problems were faced squarely, analyzed, and met with plans to overcome or learn from them. Inner work life faltered when problems were ignored, punished, or handled haphazardly. Learning from success mattered, too. Our participants’ thoughts, feelings, and drives fared better when successes, even small ones, were celebrated and then analyzed for knowledge gained. They fared worse when success was ignored, or when its true value was questioned.

Allowing ideas to flow.10 Our research participants had some of their best days when ideas about their projects flowed freely within the team and across the organization. We found that ideas flowed best when managers truly listened to their workers, encouraged vigorous debate of diverse perspectives, and respected constructive critiques—even of themselves. When this crucial catalyst was missing or inhibited—when managers shut down debate or harshly criticized new ideas—people seemed to shrink into themselves. In self-protective mode, inner work life is dominated by fearful emotions, negative perceptions of the work environment, and stunted motivation.

Three main climate forces shape the specific catalyst and inhibitor events that occur inside an organization: Consideration for people and their ideas.In word and deed, do top managers honor the dignity of employees and the value of their ideas? Do other managers, too, serve as examples of civil discourse and welcome every individual’s contributions? Coordination.Are systems and procedures designed to facilitate smooth collaboration between individuals and groups? Is the organizational structure congruent with the organization’s strategic goals and employees’ skills to meet those goals? Communication.This is perhaps the most powerful force. Clear, honest, respectful, and free-flowing communication is essential for sustaining progress, coordinating work, establishing trust, and conveying that people and their ideas have value to the organization.

This crude rebuke by a top executive, in a meeting attended by many managers and team leaders, was only the most egregious of many instances in which analyses, opinions, or new ideas met with a chilly reception, open insult, or blatant mockery. More often than not, the perpetrators were high-level managers. Rather than creating the psychological safety essential for making good decisions, exploring new ideas, and taking reasonable risks, Karpenter managers repeatedly stanched ideas at their source. This negativity had a particularly devastating effect on the inner work lives of inexperienced team leaders like Steve, who began to shrink from confrontation and taking a stand on any issue.

When people see that leaders can’t or won’t support their work, they view themselves like tightrope walkers working without a net. When leadership or other groups actively hinder their work, they feel like someone is shaking that tightrope. Motivation decays because such tenuous support provokes anxiety and signals that the work is either unimportant or doomed to failure—or both.

The nourishment factor refers to something that everyone craves at work: human connection. You nourish the inner work lives of your subordinates when you reward or recognize their good work, encourage them, or offer emotional support. You might also help resolve interpersonal conflicts, provide opportunities for people to really know each other, or simply let them have some fun.

Encouragement.6Encouraging people can nourish their inner work lives in a couple of ways. First, a manager’s own enthusiasm can help to increase employees’ motivation for the work. This is especially true when that encouragement includes statements about the importance of the work. Second, when a manager expresses confidence that people are capable of doing the work well, this message increases their sense of self-efficacy—their own belief that they are effective human beings.

Emotional support.7Because emotions constitute one of the three essential components of inner work life, people feel more connected to others at work when their emotions are validated. This goes for emotions arising from events at work, like frustration at stubborn technical problems, as well as events in personal life, like grief following a loved one’s death. Managers who simply acknowledge people’s sorrows and frustrations—as well as their joys—can do much to alleviate the negative and amplify the positive emotions.

The need to bond with coworkers collaborating to achieve a shared mission does not evaporate when people do most of their work from their home offices or airport lounges.

Generally, the more closely bonded team members are to one another, the better inner work life will be across a team, and the greater their progress. In discussing team affiliation, we include a number of behaviors: doing anything explicitly for the sake of the team (rather than simply the work or the project); doing something to increase emotional bonding within the team; having fun with teammates at work or outside of work; and demonstrated pride, affection, or warmth for a teammate or the team as a whole.

Man, therefore, needs metaphysics, epistemology and ethics; i.e., he needs philosophy.

Before you come to ethics, you must answer the questions posed by metaphysics and epistemology: Is man a rational being, able to deal with reality—or is he a helplessly blind misfit, a chip buffeted by the universal flux? Are achievement and enjoyment possible to man on earth—or is he doomed to failure and disaster? Depending on the answers, you can proceed to consider the questions posed by ethics: What is good or evil for man—and why? Should man’s primary concern be a quest for joy—or an escape from suffering? Should man hold self-fulfillment—or self-destruction—as the goal of his life? Should man pursue his values—or should he place the interests of others above his own? Should man seek happiness—or self-sacrifice?

As a human being, you have no choice about the fact that you need a philosophy. Your only choice is whether you define your philosophy by a conscious, rational, disciplined process of thought and scrupulously logical deliberation—or let your subconscious accumulate a junk heap of unwarranted conclusions, false generalizations, undefined contradictions, undigested slogans, unidentified wishes, doubts and fears, thrown together by chance, but integrated by your subconscious into a kind of mongrel philosophy and fused into a single, solid weight: self-doubt, like a ball and chain in the place where your mind’s wings should have grown.

Your subconscious is like a computer—more complex a computer than men can build—and its main function is the integration of your ideas. Who programs it? Your conscious mind. If you default, if you don’t reach any firm convictions, your subconscious is programmed by chance—and you deliver yourself into the power of ideas you do not know you have accepted. But one way or the other, your computer gives you print-outs, daily and hourly, in the form of emotions—which are lightning-like estimates of the things around you, calculated according to your values. If you programmed your computer by conscious thinking, you know the nature of your values and emotions. If you didn’t, you don’t.

He does not know whether its programming is true or false, right or wrong, whether it’s set to lead him to success or destruction, whether it serves his goals or those of some evil, unknowable power. He is blind on two fronts: blind to the world around him and to his own inner world, unable to grasp reality or his own motives, and he is in chronic terror of both.

An emotion as such tells you nothing about reality, beyond the fact that something makes you feel something. Without a ruthlessly honest commitment to introspection—to the conceptual identification of your inner states—you will not discover what you feel, what arouses the feeling, and whether your feeling is an appropriate response to the facts of reality, or a mistaken response, or a vicious illusion produced by years of self-deception.

One further suggestion: if you undertake the task of philosophical detection, drop the dangerous little catch phrase which advises you to keep an “open mind.” This is a very ambiguous term—as demonstrated by a man who once accused a famous politician of having “a wide open mind.” That term is an anti-concept: it is usually taken to mean an objective, unbiased approach to ideas, but it is used as a call for perpetual skepticism, for holding no firm convictions and granting plausibility to anything.

What objectivity and the study of philosophy require is not an “open mind,” but an active mind—a mind able and eagerly willing to examine ideas, but to examine them critically. An active mind does not grant equal status to truth and falsehood; it does not remain floating forever in a stagnant vacuum of neutrality and uncertainty; by assuming the responsibility of judgment, it reaches firm convictions and holds to them. Since it is able to prove its convictions, an active mind achieves an unassailable certainty in confrontations with assailants—a certainty untainted by spots of blind faith, approximation, evasion and fear.

There’s a fine line between keeping in close touch with how your subordinates are doing and micromanaging them. Some team leaders in our study stepped way over the wrong side of that line. Operating under a misguided notion of what management involves, they held themselves aloof from their teams.2 Rather than working collaboratively with the team and checking in with team members regularly, as Graham did, these team leaders spent much of their time checking up on people. Subordinates can tell the difference, and the consequences for inner work life are not good.

The main characteristic of this mentality is a special kind of passivity: not passivity as such and not across-the-board, but passivity beyond a certain limit—i.e., passivity in regard to the process of conceptualization and, therefore, in regard to fundamental principles. It is a mentality which decided, at a certain point of development, that it knows enough and does not care to look further. What does it accept as “enough”? The immediately given, directly perceivable concretes of its background—“the empiric element in experience.”

The two cardinal questions, the prime movers of a human mind—“Why?” and “What for?”—are alien to an anti-conceptual mentality. If asked, they elicit nothing beyond the conventionally accepted answers. The answers are usually some equivalent of “Such is life” or “One is supposed to.” Whose life? Blank out. Supposed—by whom? Blank out.

paradoxically enough, the hidebound traditionalist and the modern college activist are two sides of the same psycho-epistemological coin.4 The first seeks to escape the terror of an unknowable future by seeking safety in the alleged wisdom of the past. (“What was good enough for my father, is good enough for me!”) The second seeks to escape the terror of an unintelligible past by screaming his way into an indefinable future. (“If it’s not good for my father, it’s not good enough for me!”) And, paradoxically enough, neither of them is able to live in the present—because man’s life span is a continuum whose only integrator is his conceptual faculty.

In the brain of an anti-conceptual person, the process of integration is largely replaced by a process of association. What his subconscious stores and automatizes is not ideas, but an indiscriminate accumulation of sundry concretes, random facts, and unidentified feelings, piled into unlabeled mental file folders. This works, up to a certain point—i.e., so long as such a person deals with other persons whose folders are stuffed similarly, and thus no search through the entire filing system is ever required.

Racism is an obvious manifestation of the anti-conceptual mentality. So is xenophobia—the fear or hatred of foreigners (“outsiders”). So is any caste system, which prescribes a man’s status (i.e., assigns him to a tribe) according to his birth; a caste system is perpetuated by a special kind of snobbishness (i.e., group loyalty) not merely among the aristocrats, but, perhaps more fiercely, among the commoners or even the serfs, who like to “know their place” and to guard it jealously against the outsiders from above or from below. So is guild socialism. So is any kind of ancestor worship or of family “solidarity” (the family including uncles, aunts and third cousins). So is any criminal gang.

The remnants of European tribalism, imported by the more timid immigrants, took the innocuous form of “ethnic” neighborhoods in cities, each neighborhood offering its own customs, traditional festivals, old-country restaurants, and words in its native language on battered store-signs. Those signs were battered, because the men who clung to the tribal rule of giving trade priorities to fellow-tribesmen, remained in the backwaters of impoverished neighborhoods, while the torrent of productive energy that placed merit above tribe, swept past them, carrying away the best of their children.

There is a crucial difference between an association and a tribe. Just as a proper society is ruled by laws, not by men, so a proper association is united by ideas, not by men, and its members are loyal to the ideas, not to the group. It is eminently reasonable that men should seek to associate with those who share their convictions and values. It is impossible to deal or even to communicate with men whose ideas are fundamentally opposed to one’s own (and one should be free not to deal with them). All proper associations are formed or joined by individual choice and on conscious, intellectual grounds (philosophical, political, professional, etc.)—not by the physiological or geographical accident of birth, and not on the ground of tradition. When men are united by ideas, i.e., by explicit principles, there is no room for favors, whims, or arbitrary power: the principles serve as an objective criterion for determining actions and for judging men, whether leaders or members.

Today, we are seeing a ghastly spectacle: a magnificent scientific civilization dominated by the morality of prehistorical savagery. The phenomenon that makes it possible is the split psycho-epistemology of “com-partmentalized” minds. Its best example are men who escape into the physical sciences (or technology or industry or business), hoping to find protection from human irrationality, and abandoning the field of ideas to the enemies of reason. Such refugees include some of mankind’s best brains. But no such refuge is possible. These men, who perform feats of conceptual integration and rational thinking in their work, become helplessly anti-conceptual in all the other aspects of their lives, particularly in human relationships and in social issues.

I was struck by the realization that the game itself and the players’ exercise of mental virtuosity are made possible by the metaphysical absolutism of the reality with which they deal. The game is ruled by the Law of Identity and its corollary, the Law of Causality. Each piece is what it is: a queen is a queen, a bishop is a bishop—and the actions each can perform are determined by its nature: a queen can move any distance in any open line, straight or diagonal, a bishop cannot; a rook can move from one side of the board to the other, a pawn cannot; etc. Their identities and the rules of their movements are immutable—and this enables the player’s mind to devise a complex, long-range strategy, so that the game depends on nothing but the power of his (and his opponent’s) ingenuity.

Nature (reality) is just as absolutist as chess, and her rules (laws) are just as immutable (more so)—but her rules and their applications are much, much more complex, and have to be discovered by man. And just as a man may memorize the rules of chess, but has to use his own mind in order to apply them, i.e., in order to play well—so each man has to use his own mind in order to apply the rules of nature, i.e., in order to live successfully.

But it was in her art, her music, that Lilian not only coped with disease but transcended it. This was clear when she played the piano, an art that both demands and provides a sort of superintegration, a total integration of sense and muscle, of body and mind, of memory and fantasy, of intellect and emotion, of one’s whole self, of being alive.

And yet, when I mentioned the Haydn quartet she had played for me before, her face lit up. “I was absolutely enthralled by that piece,” she said. “I’d never heard it before. It’s very rarely played.” And she described for me again how, unable to get it out of her head, she had arranged it, mentally, for the piano, overnight. I asked her to play it for me again. Lilian demurred, and then, persuaded, started for the piano, but went in the wrong direction. Claude corrected her gently. At the piano, she first blundered, hitting wrong notes, and seemed anxious and confused. “Where am I?” she cried, and my heart sank. But then she found her place and began to play beautifully, the sound soaring up, melting, twisting into itself. Claude was amazed and moved by this. “She hasn’t played at all for two or three weeks,” he whispered to me. As she played, Lilian stared upward, singing the melody softly to herself. She played with consummate artistry, with all the power and feeling she had shown before, as Haydn’s music swelled into a furious turbulence, a musical altercation. Then, as the quartet drew to its final, resolving chords, she said, simply, “All is forgiven.”

Wittgenstein, the philosopher, distinguished two methods of communication and representation: “saying” and “showing.” Saying, in the sense of propositionizing, is assertive and requires a tight coupling of logical and syntactic structure with what it asserts. Showing is not assertive; it presents information directly, in a nonsymbolic way, but, as Wittgenstein was forced to concede, it has no underlying grammar or syntactic structure.

Music therapy is invaluable for some patients with expressive aphasia; finding that they can sing the words to a song, they are reassured that language is not wholly lost, that they still have access to words somewhere inside them. The question is then whether the language capacities embedded in song can be removed from their musical context and used for communication. This is sometimes possible to a limited extent, by reembedding words in a sort of improvised singsong.

IT IS WITH OUR FACES that we face the world, from the moment of birth to the moment of death. Our age and our sex are printed on our faces. Our emotions, the open and instinctive emotions which Darwin wrote about, as well as the hidden or repressed ones which Freud wrote about, are displayed on our faces, along with our thoughts and intentions. Though we may admire arms and legs, breasts and buttocks, it is the face, first and last, which is judged “beautiful” in an aesthetic sense, “fine” or “distinguished” in a moral or intellectual sense. And, crucially, it is by our faces that we can be recognized as individuals. Our faces bear the stamp of our experiences and character; at forty, it is said, a man has the face he deserves.

Some researchers have proposed that prosopagnosia is not purely a problem with face-blindness, but one aspect of a more general difficulty in distinguishing the individuals in any class, whether the class is of faces, cars, birds, or anything else. Isabel Gauthier and her colleagues at Vanderbilt tested a group of car experts and a group of expert birders, comparing them to a group of normal subjects. The fusiform face area, they found, was activated when all of the groups looked at pictures of faces. But it was also activated in the car experts when they were asked to identify particular cars, and in the birders when they were asked to identify particular birds. The fusiform face area is primarily tuned for facial recognition, but some of it, it seems, can be trained to distinguish individual items of other sorts.

WHEN GALEN, in the second century, and Leonardo, thirteen centuries later, observed that the images received by the two eyes were slightly different, neither of them appreciated the full significance of these differences. It was not until the early 1830s that Charles Wheatstone, a young physicist, began to suspect that even though the brain somehow fused these images automatically and unconsciously, the disparities between the two retinal images were in fact crucial to the brain’s mysterious ability to generate a sensation of depth.

There are, of course, many other ways of judging depth besides stereo vision: the occlusion of distant objects by closer objects, perspective (the fact that parallel lines converge as they recede, and that distant objects appear smaller), shading (which delineates the shape of objects), “aerial” perspective (the blurring and blueing of more distant objects by the intervening air), and, most important, motion parallax—the changing appearance of spatial relationships as we move around in the world. All these cues, acting together, can give a sense of reality and space and depth. But the only way to actually perceive depth—to see it rather than judge it—is with binocular stereoscopy.

After reading how Wheatstone explored stereoscopic effects by exaggerating or reversing the disparity between the two images, I began experimenting with this, too. I started taking pictures with greater and greater separations between them, and then I made a hyperstereoscope, using a cardboard tube about a yard long with four little mirrors. With this, I could turn myself, in effect, into a creature with eyes a yard apart. I could look through the hyperstereoscope at a very distant object, like the dome of St. Paul’s Cathedral, which normally appeared as a flat semicircle on the horizon, and see it in its full rotundity, projecting towards me. I also experimented with making a “pseudoscope,” which transposed the views of the two eyes to reverse the stereo effect to some extent, making distant objects appear closer than near ones and even turning faces into hollow masks. This, of course, contradicted common sense, as well as all the other depth cues of perspective and occlusion—sometimes the images would rapidly shift back and forth from convex to concave, a bizarre and disorienting experience as the brain struggled to reconcile two rival hypotheses.

One could also get Polaroid Vectographs, in which the stereo images were polarized at right angles to each other; these were viewed through a special pair of Polaroid glasses with the polarization of the lenses also at right angles, insuring that each eye saw only its own image. Such Vectographs, unlike the red-and-green anaglyphs, could be in full color, which gave them a special appeal.

And stereopsis, as a biological strategy, is crucial to a diverse array of animals. Predators, in general, have forward-facing eyes, with much overlap of the two visual fields; prey animals, by contrast, tend to have eyes at the sides of their heads, which gives them panoramic vision, helping them spot danger even if it comes from behind. The hammerhead shark is a fearsome predator, partly because its bizarre head shape allows its forward-facing eyes a greater separation—a hammerhead is a living hyperstereoscope. Another astonishing strategy is found in the cuttlefish, whose wide-set eyes normally permit a large degree of panoramic vision but can be rotated forward by a special muscular mechanism when the animal is about to attack, giving it the binocular vision it needs for shooting out its tentacles with deadly aim.

The Lean Startup method, in contrast, is designed to teach you how to drive a startup. Instead of making complex plans that are based on a lot of assumptions, you can make constant adjustments with a steering wheel called the Build-Measure-Learn feedback loop.

Positive changes in metrics became the quantitative validation that our learning was real. This was critically important because we could show our stakeholders—employees, investors, and ourselves—that we were making genuine progress, not deluding ourselves. It is also the right way to think about productivity in a startup: not in terms of how much stuff we are building but in terms of how much validated learning we’re getting for our efforts.

By building a product instead, albeit a simple one, the company learned much more: 1. It had more accurate data about customer demand because it was observing real customer behavior, not asking hypothetical questions. 2. It put itself in a position to interact with real customers and learn about their needs. For example, the business plan might call for discounted pricing, but how are customer perceptions of the product affected by the discounting strategy? 3. It allowed itself to be surprised when customers behaved in unexpected ways, revealing information Zappos might not have known to ask about.

Every business plan begins with a set of assumptions. It lays out a strategy that takes those assumptions as a given and proceeds to show how to achieve the company’s vision.

The goal of such early contact with customers is not to gain definitive answers.

Modern production processes rely on high quality as a way to boost efficiency. They operate using W. Edwards Deming’s famous dictum that the customer is the most important part of the production process. This means that we must focus our energies exclusively on producing outcomes that the customer perceives as valuable.

Most modern business and engineering philosophies focus on producing high-quality experiences for customers as a primary principle; it is the foundation of Six Sigma, lean manufacturing, design thinking, extreme programming, and the software craftsmanship movement. These discussions of quality presuppose that the company already knows what attributes of the product the customer will perceive as worthwhile. In a startup, this is a risky assumption to make. Often we are not even sure who the customer is.

you need to understand something called cohort analysis. This is one of the most important tools of startup analytics. Although it sounds complex, it is based on a simple premise. Instead of looking at cumulative totals or gross numbers such as total revenue and total number of customers, one looks at the performance of each group of customers that comes into contact with the product independently. Each group is called a cohort.

Geoffrey Moore, in his 1992 book Crossing the Chasm adapted and popularized the concept of the “Technology Life Cycle Adoption Curve,” whereby technology is adopted in five phases categorized by the type of buyer: Innovators – aggressively pursue new technology, often out of pure interest in technology. Early adopters – are the first to pursue technology for its intrinsic benefits. Early majority – rely on benefits of new technology, but will wait for others to work out the kinks. Late majority – not interested in technology per se; waits for established leader to emerge, buys de facto standard. Laggards – don’t want anything to do with technology; uses technology when it’s without knowledge of its existence.

If you validate key assumptions, you have proven critically important aspects of your business model. If you hit unexpected roadblocks and points of failure, then you have increased your odds of success by catching these issues early.

Taleb: “The narrative fallacy addresses our limited ability to look at sequences of facts without weaving an explanation into them, or, equivalently, forcing a logical link, an arrow of relationship, upon them. Explanations bind facts together. They make them all the more easily remembered; they help them make more sense. Where this propensity can go wrong is when it increases our impression of understanding.”

(Lean manufacturing faced similar problems when it was introduced in factories. Managers were used to focusing on the utilization rate of each machine. Factories were designed to keep machines running at full capacity as much of the time as possible. Viewed from the perspective of the machine, that is efficient, but from the point of view of the productivity of the entire factory, it is wildly inefficient at times. As they say in systems theory, that which optimizes one part of the system necessarily undermines the system as a whole.)

Measuring runway through the lens of pivots rather than that of time suggests another way to extend that runway: get to each pivot faster.

Remember that the rationale for building low-quality MVPs is that developing any features beyond what early adopters require is a form of waste. However, the logic of this takes you only so far. Once you have found success with early adopters, you want to sell to mainstream customers. Mainstream customers have different requirements and are much more demanding. The kind of pivot we needed is called a customer segment pivot. In this pivot, the company realizes that the product it’s building solves a real problem for real customers but that they are not the customers it originally planned to serve. In other words, the product hypothesis is confirmed only partially.

Because moving the batch forward often results in additional work, rework, delays, and interruptions, everyone has an incentive to do work in ever-larger batches, trying to minimize this overhead. This is called the large-batch death spiral because, unlike in manufacturing, there are no physical limits on the maximum size of a batch.

Eventually, one batch will become the highest-priority project, a “bet the company” new version of the product, because the company has taken such a long time since the last release. But now the managers are incentivized to increase batch size rather than ship the product. In light of how long the product has been in development, why not fix one more bug or add one more feature? Who really wants to be the manager who risked the success of this huge release by failing to address a potentially critical flaw?

Startups struggle to see their work-in-progress inventory. When factories have excess WIP, it literally piles up on the factory floor. Because most startup work is intangible, it’s not nearly as visible. For example, all the work that goes into designing the minimum viable product is—until the moment that product is shipped—just WIP inventory. Incomplete designs, not-yet-validated assumptions, and most business plans are WIP.

These experiences (like many others in the past two years) set me to thinking of Edwin Abbott’s classic 1884 book Flatland, where the inhabitants of his two-dimensional world are themselves two-dimensional geometric figures. Occasionally they are confronted by spontaneous changes in the appearance of things which can only be explained, their theorists tell them, if one postulates the existence of three-dimensional objects moving in a three-dimensional space, presenting slices of themselves as they intersect the plane of Flatland. Thus Flatlanders infer the existence of a spatial dimension they cannot see.

Post-industrial capitalist ideology tends to treat the individual as someone for whom enjoyment is without limit. She is portrayed as someone who can endlessly push back the boundaries of pleasure, constantly satisfying her ever-expanding desires. Paradoxically, however, many people do not find satisfaction in a society seemingly without boundaries, and often swerve instead onto a path of self-destruction.

The sociologist Richard Sennett points out: One of the oldest usages of the word ‘tyranny’ in political thought is a synonym for sovereignty. When all matters are referred to a common, sovereign principle or reason, that principle or person tyrannizes the life of a society … An institution can rule as a single fount of authority; a belief can serve as a single standard for measuring reality.

Today’s advice culture presents the search for a spouse as not all that different from the search for a car: first we need to weigh up all the advantages and disadvantages, then we need to secure a prenuptial agreement, mend things if they go wrong and eventually trade in the old model for a new one, before finally getting tired of all the hassle of commitment and deciding to go for a temporary lease agreement.

The problem, Althusser suggests, is that we don’t notice the forms in which our lives are constructed. Society functions as something obvious, something given, almost natural. In order to understand the hidden imperatives, the codes of being, the secret requirements that philosophers call ‘ideologies’, we need to remove the veil of obviousness and given-ness. Only then do we notice the bizarre but highly ordered logic that we obey, unthinkingly, in our everyday lives.

We may not think that our choices are limitless or that we are fully capable of determining the direction of our lives and making ourselves whatever we want to be, but we believe that someone else believes in these ideas and so we do not express our disbelief. For the ideology of choice to hold such power in post-industrial society, all that is needed is for people to keep their disbelief to themselves.

They ask themselves: should this be a matter of individual choice?) • they are afraid that they are not actually making a free choice (since they suspect that other people or even enterprises with their marketing strategies are already ‘choosing’ for them)

The ideology that promotes choice so forcefully paradoxically requires some form of denial, which psychoanalysis sees as an essential mechanism through which the individual deals with his or her inner conflicts. With consumers, the first level of denial is linked to the view that there are no limits to consumption and that anyone can pursue it, but the second level of denial involves the need to deny the actual quantity of consumption, to perceive consumption as something that has not actually happened. The unrestrained consumer thus creates the illusion that their consumption does not involve painful consequences – i.e. that the debt does not need to be repaid.

Money is perceived as a security blanket against decay – as protection against illness, infirmity, solitude. But at the same time we derive a special enjoyment from spending it freely, in defying death. That is why money in psychoanalytic terms is often perceived in an anal way – as sublime shit that both fascinates us and horrifies us. How else can we understand the great pleasure that comes from throwing money away – from gambling or buying things we don’t need?

Philosophers have long observed a connection between anxiety and choice. For Kierkegaard, anxiety grew directly out of freedom – out of the need to face the possibility of possibility. Sartre glossed this by saying that a person standing in front of the abyss is anxious not because he may fall, but because he is free to throw himself over the edge.

The overarching problem with crafting an identity is that a person may temporarily find solace in saying, for example, that he is a teacher, a father, a husband or a musician. But none of these identities says everything there is to say about who he actually is.

It may be hard for us to accept that what we think of as pure individual choice is so often contingent on the perceptions and influences of others. We want to believe we are in total control and entirely autonomous. And yet we are nagged by the sense that we don’t know enough, or that we’re not properly equipped, to make an informed choice. Then, when we hear from an authority, we question the value of that input.

The desire to identify with celebrities can also be understood in a slightly more complex way by introducing the concept of ‘interpassivity’ coined by the Austrian philosopher Robert Phaller.11 Interpassivity occurs between an individual and his or her proxy, who is charged with experiencing something on the other’s behalf.

When it comes to celebrities, some people act outrageously in imitation of those they identify with, while for others the celebrity takes on a proxy role, behaving outrageously so the fan does not have to and can enjoy the vicarious thrill of the celebrity’s excesses without having to take on any of the risks involved. To identify with a celebrity, then, is often not to copy them but rather to assume a kind of distance. A young girl might very well copy what Paris Hilton is wearing while shunning Hilton’s lifestyle: Paris Hilton is a proxy who lives a wild, glamorous and damaging life so that the young girl doesn’t have to.

Medicine now glorifies the idea of choice and self-mastery. A doctor no longer plays the role of an authority, advising what course of action is best for the patient; now he often simply tells the patient what their options are, leaving them to make a decision and to give (or refuse) their informed consent.13 Often this will involve a difficult and complex decision with far-reaching consequences, and without the specialist knowledge and training at a doctor’s disposal the concept of informed consent may become a mockery, a way of simply avoiding responsibility and possible lawsuits if things go wrong.

Lacanian psychoanalysis introduced the term the ‘Big Other’ to designate language, institutions and culture – everything that collectively makes up the social space in which we live. This space defines us throughout our lives, and we often create our own perception of it, picturing it as something rather coherent and full of symbols, the understanding of which we share with those who inhabit the same social milieu.

One of the cornerstones of Lacanian theory is the idea that by learning to speak we undergo a process of symbolic castration, and that we are marked for ever after by a lack. The agent of castration is language itself. When we become speaking beings, something radical changes for us: ‘natural’ acts become much more complicated, and our existence per se appears to be devoid of some primordial jouissance or blissful pre-linguistic enjoyment.20 We suddenly need to use language in order to deal with our wants, and soon afterwards we also need to deal with desires and drives that have no primal links to biology, but which nonetheless radically affect our well-being. Language and culture, which we encounter when coming into the world, soon become not only ways of expanding our horizons but also a space of prohibition and limits to what were, at the beginning, still natural impulses.

The very fact that people are marked by a lack is thus the engine that keeps their desire alive. Thus we endlessly go on searching for the thing we hope will bring satisfaction – be it a partner, a child or a simple consumer item – and often feel dissatisfied by our choices. At the same time, however, we often feel that other people are experiencing the jouissance that we are searching for, which in turn provokes envy or jealousy.

In such a society the market becomes the Big Other.

Contemporary dating rituals follow a principle of avoiding intimacy and concentrate on the mechanics of contact. ‘Hooking up’ serves as the supreme example. This very choice of expression reveals much about the perception of sex and love in the time of tyranny of choice. Enjoyment is no longer about searching for a spouse or a friend, coming close to the chosen object or trying to comprehend or penetrate his or her often unsettling otherness. It is about taking gratification from the process of hooking – enticing, seducing, trapping and then discarding – unhooking – and searching for a new object. This lack of commitment is the new vogue in relationships.

Proponents of hooking up will claim that the ritual mostly helps people to avoid getting attached too soon and that it allows people to make the best possible choice of future partner.2 Young women especially need to protect themselves from too much investment in the encounter or too quick a commitment to the partner, they argue.3 By keeping their options open, they will be able to focus fully on their careers and be more flexible in their future decisions. Hook-up culture is thus supposed to be about women making new rules. They are finally able to behave in the way men have behaved so often in the past. They can pick someone up randomly for a night and afterwards behave as though nothing has happened. They make no promises, and they make no demands. And since they do not want to be hurt again and again, they try not to invest too much emotion in the encounter.

in spite of this insistence on choice and control, the hook-up culture thrives on uncertainty. It may have been ‘invented’ to free young people from attachment, but it increases feelings of insecurity, anxiety and guilt. To appease these feelings, the ritual very often incorporates alcohol.

Freud was asked by a friend whether he should marry a particular woman. When it comes to the small matters in life, Freud answered, one should think long and hard, but when it comes to the big ones – whether or not to marry, whether to have children – one should just go ahead and do it. This answer sounds profoundly paradoxical, and it should be read in the context of the much more conservative society that Freud lived in. Still, the idea can be liberating if we accept that our choices in love and family are seldom rational. No matter how much we think we choose our direction, more often than not it’s our unconscious desires that are in control.

It sometimes appears as though choice applies only to the person seeking advice, and that the goal is to take it away from the prospective partner.

the idea of the market, which has always been implicit in the dating game, has suddenly come out into the open. People want to make the best deal possible: they search for someone they imagine comes with a higher ‘price tag’ than themselves.8 The internet thus in a new way instrumentalises intimate relationships by looking at them through the imagined ‘value’ one has in this cyberspace love market.

One of the timeless dilemmas of romantic relationships is that a person will often love in the other what the other does not actually possess – some sublime thing that the lover perceives in the beloved and out of which he creates a fantasy that keeps his love alive. But the fascination with a non-existent sublime object can quickly turn into disgust, which is why love and hate are the two sides of the same coin.

Do we still have a space for sublime, romantic love, or have we turned into a narcissistic culture less concerned with love and desire than with finding quick, temporary sexual satisfaction? The search for the latter is more about an attempt to recover some lost jouissance and less about a desire to engage with another as a person, which is why the feeling of loneliness often kicks in when the encounter is over.

Lebrun asks whether current social changes have led to changes in the process of symbolic castration. In a society where authority has grown lax, there seems to be a turn towards androgyny and bisexuality. Similarly the form in which our sexuality presents itself seems to have become more narcissistic. Lebrun’s pessimistic conclusion is that sexuality is becoming more and more ‘a matter of competitive rivalry and consummation, it does not concern anymore a choice of a stable object. It is primarily a matter of seduction.’

Social prohibitions will always bring with them some form of dissatisfaction. We often complain when there are barriers to our satisfaction: when we want to own a particular object we can’t afford, for example, or when we are in love with someone who does not return that love. But strangely, when the obstacles to our satisfaction cease to exist and we get what we wish for, we may also have the feeling that this is not what we wanted at all and begin to search for something else. Such manifestations of dissatisfaction are an intrinsic part of how desire operates.

Deciding on ‘the road less travelled’ sounds like a brave idea – it epitomises the ideology of risk-taking, of standing alone and heading down the solitary path. Yet the road not taken will continue to haunt us. To resist the nagging doubt, we spin out a story, a narrative, to support the choice we made, recalling portents and distinguishing features of the options we had. But in fact, as with Frost’s two similar tracks in the wood, we may have seen no difference at the time.

The ultimate dilemma of choice lies with the fact that every human life is, in the most fundamental way, optional. Albert Camus put it this way: ‘Shall I kill myself or have a cup of coffee?’ Beyond all the little decisions that decide what kind of life we will live lies the question of whether to continue living at all.

Subjectivisation for Lacan is about the process of how the Big Other – the symbolic structure (for example, language, culture and institutions) into which the subject is born – marks the subject in a particular way. It is not simply that the subject has to go through a process of socialisation through which he will inadvertently become a social being. Becoming a subject also involves a particular moment of choice, which is not a rational choice but rather something that Lacan refers to as ‘forced choice’.

In cases where someone is offered a choice and at the same time deprived of it, they are of course not given a choice at all. But forced choice still holds value as an important part of the social bond. The very fact that we have cases of forced choice suggests that society understands that everyone is capable of freedom. Society cannot simply reject this freedom. Even the most severe forms of totalitarian regime often resorted to acts of forced choice, showing that coercion can frequently be based on a fantasy of the individual’s free submission to the regime’s orders.

Our anxiety about the idea of death is often linked to two contradicting causes: first, the fact that we have no choice in regard to it, since everyone must die; and second, the fact that we do have the power to end our life by our own will. In order to appease this anxiety, religions often offer ideas about a possible continuation of spiritual existence after the body passes away. Today, however, we try to keep anxiety over death in check by inventing ever new ways to postpone death or to perceive it as something that one can control – through euthanasia, for example.

Psychoanalysis understands such creative circulation around a particular issue as a form of sublimation. Instead of making a ‘choice’ of a symptom through which a person would articulate his suffering, the person engages in a professional pursuit or, in other words, sublimates his drives. This sublimation results in the production of a work of art that others can admire.

The paradox is that the obsessive attitudes promoted by the ideology of late capitalism actually leave very little room for choice. The highly controlled individual who is constantly on guard, who dreads disorder and who is petrified by the thought of dying derives very little enjoyment from playing out the supposedly limitless possibilities of choice. He is in the grip of an anxiety about failing to be the ideal ‘chooser’. So he invents ever new ways of restricting choice.

After over two years of development, the new product was launched with great expectations—and bombed. What went wrong? Somewhere between the idea and the launch, the product vision was lost amid the many handoffs. Product marketing performed the market research, wrote the product concept, and passed the concept on to the product manager. The product manager wrote the requirements specification and handed it off to the project manager, who passed it on to the development teams. There was no single person responsible for leading the effort to create a winning product, and no shared vision of what the product should look like and do. Everyone involved had a different view, a different vision.

overworked product owners quickly become bottlenecks and limit the project’s progress. Symptoms of an overworked product owner include neglecting product backlog grooming, missing sprint planning or review meetings, and not being available for questions or giving answers only after a long delay.

Some organizations split the product owner role and distribute its duties across several people, for instance, by employing a product manager and a “product owner.” The product manager takes care of the product marketing and product management aspects, owns the vision, is outward-facing, and keeps in touch with the market. The “product owner” is inward-facing, drives the sprints, and works with the team. In these cases, the so-called product owner is little more than a product backlog item writer. This approach reinforces old barriers, blurs responsibility and authority, and causes handoffs, delays, and other waste.

The business analyst on the team consequently stood in as a proxy product owner when the real product owner could not be there. The proxy did most of the product owner work without being empowered. The actual product owner ultimately decided about product backlog prioritization, release planning, and whether to accept or reject work results. What followed was an increase in conflicts and miscommunication, a slowdown in decision making, and a decrease in productivity and morale.

Using a proxy product owner is an attempt to superficially treat a systemic issue. Rather than employing a quick fix, organizations should address the underlying issues. This might require freeing up the product owner from other obligations; colocating the product owner, ScrumMaster, and team; or even finding a new product owner.

A product owner committee is a group of product owners without anyone in charge of the overall product. There is no one person guiding the group, helping to create a common goal, and facilitating decision making. A product owner committee is in danger of getting caught in endless meetings with conflicting interests and politics—something also referred to as “death by committee.”

To create a vision, the Scrum team has to peek into the future and state what it believes the future product will roughly look like and do. For anyone not blessed with perfect foresight, predicting the future correctly is notoriously difficult. After all, the only thing certain about the future is that it is uncertain. No market research technique can deliver forecasts that are 100% accurate. And making a completely fail-safe investment is an illusion.

The accuracy of predicting a market response is influenced by the market dynamics and the degree of innovation of the product. For steady-state markets and products exhibiting continuous or incremental innovation, it may be possible to anticipate the market response fairly well. For other markets and products it is difficult or even impossible—as in the case of disruptive innovation. Christensen (1997, 143) observes: “Markets that do not exist cannot be analyzed.”

The term minimal marketable product is a reference to Mark Denne and Jane Cleland-Huang’s work. In their book Software by Numbers (2004) they coin the term minimal marketable feature set to denote the smallest amount of functionality creating value for a customer. The idea of delivering a small set of features quickly and enhancing the product incrementally dates back to Tom Gilb’s evolutionary delivery method

Creating a minimal product provides us with a number of advantages, as noted by Smith and Reinertsen (1997) and Denne and Cleland-Huang (2004).5 The product is launched more quickly and time to market is reduced; functionality is released in a more timely manner. The product is developed at a lower cost and generates a higher return on investment. Payments are received earlier, improving the cash flow, and learning is accelerated. By reducing time to market, we are able to listen and respond to the marketplace more frequently, rather than trying to outguess it. Getting a minimal product out quickly also improves risk mitigation. Less money is lost if the product underperforms and has to be withdrawn from the market early. This allows us to build the possibility of failure into our strategy, an approach Google has embraced.

Once the vision is available, it is turned into a shippable product by leveraging customer and user feedback; the feedback is collected by demoing product increments in the sprint review meetings and by releasing software early and frequently. Working this way allows the Scrum team to find out quickly if the right product is being developed. If not, the vision is ill conceived and has to be adapted.

Whenever you have an idea for a new feature or you discover a new requirement, ask yourself if the new functionality is critical to the success of the product. If not, discard the idea. This results in a product that is simple and uncluttered, that offers only the features a customer or user needs.

Customer needs and product attributes are at the heart of the vision and deserve close attention. Selecting the relevant customer needs tells us which market or market segment we are going to address. By focusing on the needs, we view the product as a means to an end—serving the customer or user. Product attributes, on the other hand, are the critical properties the product must have in order to meet these needs.

Cockburn (2005, 147) suggests using the following prioritization factors for product attributes: • Sacrifice others for this • Try to keep • Sacrifice these for others To prioritize serviceability over interoperability, for example, we would sacrifice other attributes for serviceability. At the same time, we would try to keep interoperability.

At the start of a new project, we often do not know what we don’t know. Worse, our target customers and lead users sometimes don’t know what they don’t know; they are not in a position to tell us correctly up front what the product must look like and do. Creating the vision is therefore best understood as a discovery process, a process of knowledge acquisition and learning that requires experimentation.

Organized experimentation follows a four-step process also known as the Deming cycle. We first develop a hypothesis (plan). We then validate the hypothesis (do) and review the results (check). If the experiment was unsuccessful, we adapt the hypothesis (if required) and carry out another round of experimentation, either to refine the result or to try out a different approach (act).

Personas help us select our target customers. Scenarios allow us to understand how the product changes their lives (Cooper 1999). A persona is a “hypothetical archetype” representing a target customer or user. You can think of a persona as a specific instance of a use case actor or a user role. Personas have names. Their descriptions include information relevant to their use of the product: for instance, their job roles, skills, or interests.

The Kano Model helps us select the right functionality to create an attractive product (Kano 1984). It tells us how satisfied the customer is likely to be when we implement a certain product attribute.

the Kano Model makes an interesting prediction: Over time, delighters will eventually become performance functions and performers will become basics. Eventually, products lose their competitive advantages as the competition begins to provide similar products. To stay ahead, companies have to regularly update the product and deliver new delighters. This correlation is another reason to quickly launch an initial product and to grow it using regular updates.

What is good? and Whom is it good for? Is it good for the organization? Is it good for those doing the work? Is it good for those for whom the work is done? Is it good for society at large? These are questions that cut deeply. They involve examining: What is true productivity for an organization? What is its source? What is needed to sustain it? What is responsibility? What does it mean to be genuinely authentic? What lifts up the human spirit and makes it sing?

“Management was originally invented,” management theorist Gary Hamel has noted, “to solve two problems: the first—getting semiskilled employees to perform repetitive activities competently, diligently, and efficiently; the second—coordinating those efforts in ways that enabled complex goods and services to be produced in large quantities. In a nutshell, the problems were efficiency and scale, and the solution was bureaucracy, with its hierarchical structure, cascading goals, precise role definitions, and elaborate rules and procedures.”

Even today, some might see nothing anomalous or disturbing in such unproductive working conditions, the lack of personal responsibility for what is being done, the systematic inattention to the outcome of work, or the lack of centrality of the client. Yet viewed through the lens of the twenty-first century, these situations are unsustainable. The work is not as productive as it could be. Innovation is stifled. Managers are trapped. Customers are dissatisfied. Brand liabilities that accrue from pursuing “bad profits” are accumulating in the background. Any kind of moral compass is absent.

A peculiar feature of traditional managerial discourse is the unspoken assumption of its inevitability. It is as though the practices of traditional management—hierarchy, command and control, tightly planned work, competition through economies of scale and cost reduction, impersonal communications—reflect timeless truths of the universe, so obvious that there is scarcely any need to articulate them, let alone reexamine them. In reality, these managerial practices arose as a response to a specific set of social and economic conditions. When those conditions change, the validity of the principles can become an issue.

When modern management was being invented almost a century ago, most employees were semiskilled workers, such as laborers and production line workers. Doing their work required little training and practically no brainpower. They were expected to do what they were told. How they felt about it was irrelevant. Traditional management was developed principally to get these semiskilled employees to perform repetitive activities competently, diligently, and efficiently. As their work has been steadily replaced by machines and computers, meeting that challenge has become steadily less relevant in today’s workplace.

The shift from semiskilled work to knowledge work has changed the relationship between those in charge and those doing the work. As management sage Peter Drucker noted, “Workers throughout history could be ‘supervised.’ They could be told what to do, how to do it, how fast to do it and so on. Knowledge workers cannot, in effect, be supervised.”

Once buyers had instant access to reliable information and became fed up with being spammed, the old model fell apart. The result was a fundamental shift in the balance of power from sellers to buyers. Now, unless clients are delighted, they can—and will—go elsewhere.

To turn customers into advocates and promoters of the firm’s goods and services, organizations must not only minimize errors: they must innovate.

Delighting clients is the primary goal—a means to competitive advantage and profitability. It takes precedence over profits, turnover, and market share.

Today managers have to recognize that they cannot delight clients or draw on the full talents of the workforce merely by sending messages and telling people what to do. Instead, they need to be having interactive conversations, using authentic narratives and open-ended questions, and engaging in deep listening. They need to be communicating with people as responsible, thinking, feeling adults, so that communications leave them energized and clients positively excited rather than dispirited and used. Managers have to stop doing things to people and start doing things with people. What business once saw as a utopian moral ideal has now become an inexorable economic necessity.

Because the management problems organizations faced were not inherently problems of technology, the introduction of technology did little to address root causes. Being designed by “experts” who didn’t always understand the requirements of the work, the solution often didn’t fit the specific workplace. Because the process changes were introduced without basic change in the behaviors of the managers or the workers, the problems caused by those behaviors continued.

Business process reengineering was something done to the workforce. For most workers, it made jobs worse. Because business process reengineering didn’t affect the goals of business, which continued to focus on improved efficiency through downsizing and outsourcing, often using fewer, less educated, and cheaper people, the social problems of the workplace were aggravated. Nor was thought given to the strategic implications of the wholesale shipping of expertise overseas to countries where workers could be more easily manipulated.

What the champions of business process reengineering failed to see was that the fundamental problem of the workplace wasn’t this or that particular system or process. The deeper problem lay precisely in thinking about work primarily as an internally driven set of processes, using people who could be manipulated, rather than viewing the workplace as an interaction of thinking, feeling, laughing, caring human beings whose talents, energies, and ingenuities are fully engaged in finding ways to delight clients.

It turns out that being more responsive in terms of time also tends to be more efficient. The origins of this principle lie partly in lean manufacturing: inventory is a problem because it ties up money and, even more important, tends to delay the discovery and resolution of quality problems. A focus on delivering value to clients each iteration also tends to lower costs. Similarly, in knowledge work, having a lot of work in process is damaging to productivity. Hence, efficiency also requires that once work is started, it should be completed as soon as possible so that work in progress is kept to a minimum.

The people doing the work could immediately see the results of it and understand how what they did related to the people they were doing it for. It wasn’t that everyone was necessarily happy, but everyone knew the meaning of their work. With the growth of giant corporations and the atomization and specialization of work, that clear line of sight of the people doing the work to the people for whom they were ultimately doing it was lost.

As a general economic theory, the new localism may be nutty, but there is nevertheless some truth in it: the importance of a clear line of sight from those doing the work to those for whom the work is intended, and the possibility of focusing work on delighting those people as a way of relieving the threat to the human spirit posed by boring, meaningless labor. This is what the shopkeepers in Golfe-Juan, Sennett’s craftsmen, Pollan’s local farmers, and Crawford’s motorcycle repairmen all have in common.

Or we could go in the opposite direction and formulate the organizational goal in terms of lofty, big-hearted ideals like beauty, truth, or love.14 These moral imperatives have aroused human beings to extraordinary accomplishments throughout the millennia. The problem with articulating a business goal in terms of such moral imperatives is that they usually have little to do with what the business is about. Cynicism sets in when the organization’s real goals turn out to be very different from the stated ideals.

Peter Drucker provided a clue as to where to look: “There is only one valid definition of business purpose: to create a customer. . . . It is the customer who determines what a business is. It is the customer alone whose willingness to pay for a good or for a service converts economic resources into wealth, things into goods.... The customer is the foundation of a business and keeps it in existence.”

A key reason that traditional management is so dispiriting and often devoid of meaning is its focus on things and systems ahead of people. In such a world, workers find it difficult to see the point of what they are doing. By contrast, once the focus is on providing a clear line of sight—and continuously updated information—as to whether and to what extent clients are being delighted by what is being done, the meaning of work becomes obvious.

When we are thinking of the goal as a thing, we tend to get stuck with the thing we started with. The thing might have been a good idea at the time, but maybe not the best idea. When we are thinking about how to delight people, a lot of options open up, both at the outset and along the way. It’s not a one-time examination but an ongoing iterative process of continuously asking: How am I intending to delight the clients and stakeholders? Are they being delighted? If not, why not? How can I change that? How can I create more opportunities to delight them? How can I delight them faster?

From a marketing viewpoint, the tricky part is that clients don’t know what they want until they experience it, and then they discover that what they thought they wanted is close to, but not exactly, what they really want. They don’t realize the implications of what they asked for, and in any event, the situation has changed, so now they want something different. Simply taking direction from what people say they want is going to lead to some mistakes. The only sure way to find out is to try the idea and see what the reaction is.

Martin notes that pursuing the maximization of shareholder value as a goal suffers from inherent internal contradictions. The harder the CEO is pushed to increase shareholder value, the more likely the CEO will make moves that actually hurt the shareholders. Since the stock price is largely driven by shareholders’ future expectations, the CEO is driven to focus on those things that boost shareholders’ future expectations, often at the expense of doing the things that will actually improve long-term value to shareholders.

Why not aim to maximize both shareholder value and client delight? The mathematics of optimization shows that only one variable can be maximized. Two variables cannot be simultaneously maximized unless one variable comprises the other. It is thus possible to maximize both satisfied clients and delighted clients because satisfied clients include delighted clients. It is not possible to maximize both client delight and shareholder value. You have to choose one or the other.

The idea was to focus on one question that connected most closely to customer repurchase rates and referrals. It took Reichheld and his colleagues several years of research to figure out which question worked best. Eventually he did find a single survey question that held out promise. That question wasn’t directly about customer enthusiasm or loyalty. Rather, it was about customers’ willingness to recommend a product or service to someone else. In fact, in most of the industries that he studied, the percentage of customers who were enthusiastic enough to refer a friend or colleague—perhaps the strongest sign of customer loyalty—correlated directly with whether they actually recommended the firm. He called this new process the net promoter score—and it is being used by a growing number of firms,

One of the issues that the net promoter methodology highlighted was the addiction that many firms had to abusive practices that boosted short-term earnings at the expense of customer loyalty. When customers are delighted, they tend to tell other people about their happy experiences. Equally, when they are unhappy about their experiences, they share that too.

“Whenever a customer feels misled, mistreated, ignored or coerced,” Reichheld writes, “then profits from that customer are bad. Bad profits come from unfair or misleading pricing. Bad profits arise when companies save money by delivering a lousy customer experience. Bad profits are about extracting value from customers, not creating value.

For those who see business as the unvarnished pursuit of profit, the very notion of bad profits is an oxymoron. For these people, a dollar is a dollar, and they should all look the same on an income statement. But Reichheld says no: bad profits are a trap. They hide brand liabilities that are accumulating behind the scenes and eventually have to be repaid in hard cash. Distinguishing between good and bad profits is thus critical to determining the true financial health of a firm.

Clumping customers into three groups—the promoters, the passively satisfied, and the detractors—turned out not only to provide the simplest, most intuitive, and best predictor of customer behavior; it also made sense to frontline managers. They could grasp intuitively what it meant to be increasing the number of promoters and reducing the number of detractors. This made more sense than trying to increase the mean of their satisfaction index by one standard deviation.

I had the answer to the puzzle as to why the largest companies are not frequently delighting me: they aren’t even trying. Instead they have simpler, less ambitious goals, with significant negative consequences. The majority of the firms see themselves as “making money for shareholders” or “producing goods and services.” This leads to a characteristic way of managing: top-down bureaucracy. Once the firm sees itself in the business of producing things, a command-and-control bureaucracy becomes the logical way to structure and manage it.

Once the firm adopts self-organizing teams aimed at delighting clients, downsizing and outsourcing are seen in their true light as counterproductive to everything the firm is trying to accomplish.53 Instead, doing work in an iterative fashion and providing value in each iteration are the norm. Radical transparency between managers and workers becomes a necessary principle for achieving the goal. Happily, when firms get into this mode, the risk of needing to downsize or outsource its core business is reduced: continuous self-improvement is a normal and natural way in which self-organizing teams evolve toward high performance.

In the twentieth century, traditional management got very good at solving puzzles. In business, the puzzle involved finding the most efficient way to deliver goods and services to eventual customers. Information could be gathered. Marketing could determine what goods and services should be supplied. Systems could be set up. Mathematical optimization techniques could be applied. As a result, productivity increased, and money was made, so management had good reason to believe that it had the right answer. But it didn’t always keep in mind that in dealing with the world in this way, it was solving tame problems, namely, puzzles.

As a result, when real teams emerged, particularly high-performance teams, management had a tendency to suppress them. That’s because a high-performance team typically becomes more productive by breaking the rules, and a bureaucracy hates having rules broken. A group that breaks rules may be tolerated for a period, but eventually the rules take over, the group is “brought back into line,” and high performance ends.

The phenomenon of teamicide isn’t unusual. Many of the high-performance teams that I came across in my research suffered that fate. They had been killed by a traditionally minded management, either willfully to bring the team back into line with the prevailing corporate norms, or by accident, as a result of splitting the team up, without realizing that this would destroy the high level of performance that had been created.

Of the large numbers of tools and techniques necessary to sustain effective teams and ensure that poorly performing teams are quickly identified and helped, three principles stand out as crucial: • Do the work in client-driven iterations. • Deliver value to clients each iteration. • Be open about impediments. They are not merely optional tools. They are foundational principles of radical management.

An almost universal characteristic of teams that achieve high performance is a compelling purpose. People will give their very best to a cause only if they believe in it and think it worthwhile. The failed teams, or pseudo-teams, as in the Hawthorne experiments, were groups of people working for bureaucratic goals—produce so many widgets. It was boring and dull.

“Lean Integration” is a management system that emphasizes continuous improvements, meaning you don’t complete the links and call it done. Integration requires an ongoing interest in the way integration is carried out and the mechanisms required. This means consistently reevaluating and improving the approaches we leverage for integration, as well as the technology employed. Integration is a journey, not a project.

Waste elimination is related to this principle, since waste consists of activities that don’t add value from the customer’s perspective rather than from the supplier’s perspective. Related concepts include optimizing the entire value stream in the interest of things that customers care about and just-in-time delivery to meet customer demands.

A metaphor for how Lean organizations uncover their problems is to imagine a lake with a rocky bottom, where the rocks represent the many quality and process problems affecting their ability to build the best products for their customers. Metaphorically, they “lower the water level” (reduce their inventories, reduce their batch sizes, and speed up reconfiguring their assembly lines, among other techniques) in order to expose the rocks on the bottom of the lake. Once the “rocks” are exposed, they can focus on continually improving themselves by fixing these problems.

Big-chunk implementation is also based on an economic error. The conventional view of iterative work processes is that doing iterations and prototypes wastes resources. Why not get it right the first time and do big production runs? Why waste time on multiple cycles? Each iteration incurs a cost in cycle time and transition expenses. Extra iterations incur extra costs and extra costs are bad, so iterations should be reduced to improve efficiency. In reality, once the art of managing quick transitions between cycles is mastered, iterative work patterns are not only more flexible and deliver higher quality; when the overall costs to the organization are taken into account, they are generally cheaper.

Thus, when radical management is applied to an apparently lumpy thing like building a house, the attention shifts from the house to the person for whom the house is being built. The goal switches from building a structure to fulfilling the client’s dream. The house is obviously the principal means by which clients fulfill their dream. But the house is the means, not the end. Radical management asks: Who are the people who need the house? Why do they need it? How can we delight them more or sooner? How do we turn the process of building the house into one that adds to the customer’s delight? It’s a change in mind-set from things to people.

Once you have the real goal, you can ask: How can we evolve toward that goal sooner? How can we delight the client with partial steps or other means? How can we give the client a taste of what it would be like so that he or she can give us feedback? Is it meeting the client’s needs? How it could be improved?

By making decisions at the last responsible moment, the team has the best information to make informed decisions. It avoids wasting resources by making unnecessary inventory or early decisions that will have to be undone. This gives the greatest chance to avoid working on something that isn’t needed, and to include the best possible ideas at the top of the list of priorities to be worked on.

A number of kanban (or cards) equivalent to the (agreed) capacity of a system are placed in circulation. One card attaches to one piece of work. Each card acts as a signaling mechanism. A new piece of work can be started only when a card is available. This free card is attached to a piece of work and follows it as it flows through the system. When there are no more free cards, no additional work can be started. Any new work must wait in a queue until a card becomes available. When some work is completed, its card is detached and recycled. With a card now free, a new piece of work in the queuing can be started.

Many aspects of a kaizen culture are in opposition to established cultural and social norms in modern Western culture. In the West, we are brought up to be competitive. Our school systems encourage competition in academics and in athletics. Even our team sports tend to encourage the development of heroes and teams built around one or two exceptionally talented players. The social norm is to focus on the individual first and to rely on outstanding individuals to deliver victory or to save us from peril. It is little wonder that we struggle in the workplace to encourage collegial behavior and systems-level thinking and cooperation.

In addition to the visibility into process flow, work-in-progress limits also force challenging interactions to happen sooner and more often.

The essence of starting with Kanban is to change as little as possible. You must resist the temptation to change workflow, job titles, roles and responsibilities, and specific working practices. Everything from which the team members and other partners, participants, and stakeholders derive their self-esteem, professional pride, and ego should be left unchanged. The main target of change will be the quantity of WIP and the interface to and interaction with upstream and downstream parts of your business. So you must work with your team to map the value stream as it exists. Try not to change it or invent it in an idealistic fashion.

The first school of thought says do not try to second-guess the location of bottleneck or the source of variability that will require a buffer. Rather, implement the system and wait for the bottleneck to reveal itself, then make changes to introduce a buffer.

Another school of thought takes a different approach. It suggests that rather than implement loose WIP limits to avoid a challenging introduction of the system, each stage should be buffered, and the activity steps should have tight limits. Bottlenecks and variability will reveal themselves by how full the buffers become.

Issue-log reviews should involve the project manager plus team members who have logged items as blocked. The main questions to be answered are “Who is assigned to and working the issue?” and “When is the expected resolution?” Issues that are not progressing and are in themselves blocked or stale should be escalated to more senior management.

Issue management and escalation is typically done very badly, even in Agile development organizations.

It is generally established in Agile software development circles that a regular cadence is important. Agile development methods achieve this with a time-boxed iteration, typically one week to four weeks in length.

Kanban does not dispense with the notion of a regular cadence, though. Kanban teams still deliver software regularly, preferring a short timescale. Kanban still delivers on the Principles Behind the Agile Manifesto[1]. However, Kanban avoids any dysfunction introduced by artificially forcing things into time-boxes.

teams have struggled to write user stories consistently small enough to fit into small, time-boxed iterations. This has led to several dysfunctions. The first is to reverse the trend to smaller iterations and go back to larger ones. The alternative is to write stories that are focused on elements of the architecture or some technical decomposition of the requirements.

Kanban decouples the time it takes to create a user story from the delivery rate. While some work is complete and ready for delivery, some other work will be in progress. Having decoupled lead time for development from delivery cadence, it makes sense to question how often prioritization (and perhaps planning and estimation) should happen. It would seem unlikely that planning, estimation, and prioritization discussions should all need to happen at the same pace as delivery and software release. They are completely different functions, often requiring the attention of different groups of people. The coordination effort around delivery is surely different from the coordination effort around prioritization of new work. Kanban allows the decoupling of these activities.

By choosing to eliminate estimation for most classes of service, both the transaction costs and the coordination costs of prioritization are reduced. This reduction facilitates much more frequent prioritization meetings because the meetings remain efficient. This has enabled kanban teams to make ad hoc or on-demand prioritization.

As a general rule, you should choose ad hoc or on-demand prioritization when you have a relatively high level of organizational maturity, low transaction costs, and low coordination costs of prioritization. Otherwise, it is better to use a regularly scheduled prioritization meeting and coordinate selection of input queue items with a regular cadence.

Buffers and queues add WIP to your system and their effect is to lengthen lead time. However, buffers and queues smooth flow and improve the predictability of that lead time. By smoothing flow, they increase throughput, so more work is delivered through the kanban system. Buffers also ensure that people are kept working and provide for greater utilization.

When introducing change, you need to be aware of the J-curve effect. Ideally, each change produces a little j where any impact on performance is shallow, then the system quickly recovers and shows improvement. If you make the WIP limits too tight, you will suffer a J-curve effect that is too deep and too long, which may cause undesirable effects: Kanban is exposing all the problems in the organization, but it may end up being blamed for making everything worse, and will be seen as part of the problem rather than the solution. So tread carefully.

the tension created by imposing a WIP limit across the value-stream is positive tension. This positive tension forces discussion about the organization’s issues and dysfunctions. The dysfunctions generate impediments to flow and result in sub-optimal productivity, lead time, and quality.

Failure load tracks how many work items we process because of earlier poor quality—how many work items are production defects or new features that have been requested through our customer-service organization because of poor usability or a failure to anticipate user needs properly.

The word compassion is derived from the Latin words pati and cum, meaning “to suffer with.” I don’t believe that compassion is our default response.

Perfectionism is not the same thing as striving to be your best. Perfectionism is not about healthy achievement and growth. Perfectionism is the belief that if we live perfect, look perfect, and act perfect, we can minimize or avoid the pain of blame, judgment, and shame. It’s a shield. Perfectionism is a twenty-ton shield that we lug around thinking it will protect us when, in fact, it’s the thing that’s really preventing us from taking ﬂight.

Perfectionism is, at its core, about trying to earn approval and acceptance. Most perfectionists were raised being praised for achievement and performance (grades, manners, rule-following, people-pleasing, appearance, sports). Somewhere along the way, we adopt this dangerous and debilitating belief system: I am what I accomplish and how well I accomplish it. Please. Perform. Perfect. Healthy striving is self-focused—How can I improve? Perfectionism is other-focused—What will they think?

Research shows that perfectionism hampers success. In fact, it’s often the path to depression, anxiety, addiction, and life-paralysis.2 Life-paralysis refers to all of the opportunities we miss because we’re too afraid to put anything out in the world that could be imperfect. It’s also all of the dreams that we don’t follow because of our deep fear of failing, making mistakes, and disappointing others.

Perfectionism is self-destructive simply because there is no such thing as perfect. Perfection is an unattainable goal. Additionally, perfectionism is more about perception—we want to be perceived as perfect. Again, this is unattainable—there is no way to control perception, regardless of how much time and energy we spend trying.

Perfectionism is addictive because when we invariably do experience shame, judgment, and blame, we often believe it’s because we weren’t perfect enough. So rather than questioning the faulty logic of perfectionism, we become even more entrenched in our quest to live, look, and do everything just right.

Feeling shamed, judged, and blamed (and the fear of these feelings) are realities of the human experience. Perfectionism actually increases the odds that we’ll experience these painful emotions and often leads to self-blame: It’s my fault. I’m feeling this way because “I’m not good enough.”

Perfectionism never happens in a vacuum. It touches everyone around us. We pass it down to our children, we infect our workplace with impossible expectations, and it’s suffocating for our friends and families. Thankfully, compassion also spreads quickly. When we’re kind to ourselves, we create a reservoir of compassion that we can extend to others. Our children learn how to be self-compassionate by watching us, and the people around us feel free to be authentic and connected.

In very simple terms, hope happens when We have the ability to set realistic goals (I know where I want to go). We are able to figure out how to achieve those goals, including the ability to stay flexible and develop alternative routes (I know how to get there, I’m persistent, and I can tolerate disappointment and try again). We believe in ourselves (I can do this!).

I spent several hundred interviews trying to better understand the consequences of numbing and how taking the edge off behaviors is related to addiction. Here’s what I learned: Most of us engage in behaviors (consciously or not) that help us to numb and take the edge of off vulnerability, pain, and discomfort. Addiction can be described as chronically and compulsively numbing and taking the edge off of feelings. We cannot selectively numb emotions. When we numb the painful emotions, we also numb the positive emotions.

From very early in our lives, we get confusing messages about the value of calm and stillness. Parents and teachers scream, “Calm down!” and “Sit still!” rather than actually modeling the behaviors they want to see. So instead of becoming practices that we want to cultivate, calm gives way to perpetuating anxiety, and the idea of stillness makes us feel jumpy.

we all have patterned ways of managing anxiety. Some of us respond to anxiety by overfunctioning and others by underfunctioning. Overfunctioners tend to move quickly to advise, rescue, take over, micromanage, and get in other people’s business rather than look inward. Underfunctioners tend to get less competent under stress. They invite others to take over and often become the focus of family gossip, worry, or concern. They can get labeled as the “irresponsible one” or the “the problem child” or the “fragile one.”

another thing that gets in the way of meaningful work is the struggle to define who we are and what we do in an honest way.

The first principles of Kanban are to limit work-in-progress and to pull work using a visual signaling system. Beyond that, we look to Lean principles, Agile principles, and the workflow and process that are already in place as our starting position. So we want to limit WIP, use visual controls and signaling, and pull work only when there is capacity to do so; but we also want small batch transfers, to prioritize by value, manage risk, make progress with imperfect information, build a high-trust culture, and respond quickly and gracefully to changes that arrive during the project.

start by asking, “If we give you high-quality code with minimal defects, and it comes with adequate notice, transparency into its complexity, and reliability of delivery, how often could you reasonably deploy it to production?” This will provoke some discussion around the definitions you’ve used, and some reassurance will be required. However, you should push for a result that maximizes business agility without over-stressing any one part of the system.

The Five Focusing Steps is a simple formula for a process of ongoing improvement. It states: Identify the constraint. Decide how to exploit the constraint. Subordinate everything else in the system to the decision made in Step 2. Elevate the constraint. Avoid inertia; identify the next constraint and return to step 2.

Many Lean consultants jumped on the concept of Waste Reduction (or elimination) and taught Lean as purely a waste-elimination exercise. In this anti-pattern of Lean, all work activities are classified as value-added or non-value-added. The non-value-added, wasteful activities, are further sub-classified into necessary and unnecessary waste. The unnecessary activities are eliminated and the necessary are reduced. Although this is a valid use of Lean tools for improvement, it tends to sub-optimize the outcome for cost reduction and leaves value on the table by not embracing the Lean ideas of Value, Value Stream, and Flow.

W. Edwards Deming is generally thought of as one of the three fathers of the Quality Assurance movement of the twentieth century. However, his contribution was considerably greater. He evolved the use of Statistical Process Control (SPC) and developed it into a management technique he called the System of Profound Knowledge. His system was intended to prevent managers from making poor-quality decisions and replacing them with statistically sound, objective, often counter-intuitive, better decisions.

There could be many reasons that the capacity-constrained resource may become idle due to a temporary lack of work. The most common way to avoid such idle time is to protect the bottleneck resource with a buffer of work. The buffer is intended to absorb the variability in the arrival rate of new work

Non-instant availability resources are not, strictly speaking, bottlenecks. However, by and large they look and feel like bottlenecks, and the actions we might take to compensate for them are similar in nature to those for a bottleneck. Anyone who has ever driven a car and stopped at a traffic light understands the concept of non-instant availability. While stopped at a red light, the car cannot flow down the road. The lack of flow is not caused by capacity constraints on the road but by a policy that allows cars traveling on another road the right to cross the road on which our car is traveling.

non-instant availability tends to be a problem with shared resources or people who are asked to perform a lot of multi-tasking. As we all know, there really is no such thing as multi-tasking in the office; what we do is frequent task switching. If we are asked to work on three things simultaneously, we work on the first thing for a while, then switch to the second, then to the third. If someone is waiting for us to finish the first thing while we are working on the second or third, then we would appear to be non-instantly available from that person’s (and the first task’s) perspective.

The metaphor of waste has been proving problematic with knowledge workers. Often, it is hard to accept as waste tasks or activities that are costs or overheads but that are necessary or essential to completing value-added work; for example, daily stand-up meetings are essential to coordinating most teams. These meetings do not directly add value to the end product, so, technically, they are “waste,” but this has been hard to accept for many Agile development practitioners.

over time there are a number of value-added activities for an iteration or project. Surrounding those activities are transaction and coordination costs. The capacity for value-added activities can be displaced by work that can be considered failure load, that is, work that is either rework or demand placed on the system because of a previously poor implementation.

pursue issue management and resolution relentlessly and, as the team matures, to move toward root-cause analysis and elimination with specific improvements designed to prevent assignable-cause variations in the future. In this approach, you leave the WIP limits, buffer sizes, and working policies fairly tight, and you cause the work to stop when things become blocked. Idle time for those people assigned to blocked work raises awareness of the blocking issue. It may cause a swarming behavior to try and fix the issue, which has been seen to encourage those idle team members to think about root causes and possible process changes that will reduce or eliminate the possibility of recurrence.

It’s dangerous to think of blocked work items as bottlenecks because it leads to the wrong kind of thinking toward resolving the problem. Blocked work items should be treated as special cause variations rather than as bottlenecks. What is similar is the desired outcome. In both cases—a bottleneck or a blocked work item—we want to resolve the issue in order to improve flow.

It is essential to track the reason for the blockage and to treat it as a first-class work item, albeit a failure-load work item. A special work item type, Issue, is set aside for this purpose. Issues are tracked using pink tickets (Figure 20.1). They should be assigned a tracking number, and a team member—usually the project manager—should be assigned to ensure resolution.

When the team is unable to resolve an issue on its own, or an external party is required to resolve an issue and is unavailable or unresponsive, the issue must be escalated to a more senior manager or other department. It is important for the organization to develop a strong capability at issue escalation. Without it, maintaining and restoring flow after a blockage can be problematic.

The escalation policies should be widely known and understood, and a document (or web site) describing them should be readily available to all team members. There should be no ambiguity over how and where to escalate a problem. By taking the time to define escalation paths and write policy around it, the team knows where to send issues for resolution. This saves time figuring out to whom an issue should be escalated and it sets expectations for those more senior individuals that they are expected to be a part of the process.

As maintenance cost goes to zero, the investment made in the product approaches being passive. Unfortunately, software tends to age poorly.

For each business value, come up with at least one way you can take a measurement of progress made. That is, if you are to implement a practice to improve a particular business value, you need to take a periodic reading to verify that the practice is working.

The relationship between smells and business value is not necessarily a one-to-one relationship. Every smell is a symptom of one more business value that can be improved. Conversely, every major business value that can be improved will cause one or more smells to be present.

A large set of bugs in a bug tracker indicates wasted work. The effort is made to find, locate, and identify these bugs—but no business value is delivered until that bug is solved, integrated, and released to the customer. A large number of bugs in the bug tracking system is a direct indicator of a significant investment in work that is never released to the customer and thus has zero value.

If iterations are done properly—that is, at the end of each iteration, a working, integrated, tested system is demonstrated—there should be no need for the hardening phase. The hardening phase indicates that our iterations are not true iterations but are merely time blocks of work. Hardening iterations indicate that the previous iterations let defects go unfound and unaddressed.

The opportunity to deceive others is ever present and often tempting, and each instance casts us onto some of the steepest ethical terrain we ever cross. Few of us are murderers or thieves, but we have all been liars. And many of us will be unable to get safely into our beds tonight without having told several lies over the course of the day.

But it can take practice to feel comfortable with this way of being in the world—to cancel plans, decline invitations, critique others’ work, etc., all while being honest about what one is thinking and feeling. To do this is also to hold a mirror up to one’s life—because a commitment to telling the truth requires that one pay attention to what the truth is in every moment. What sort of person are you?

Ethical transgressions are generally divided into two categories: the bad things we do (acts of commission) and the good things we fail to do (acts of omission).

It is interesting to watch what typically happens when a traditional   organization experiments with teams. First, a big hurrah   will be sounded: "We are going to teams!" Then, people get  reorganized into new accountability hierarchies that look just  like the old ones, except that the new ones have different labels.  The team (former department) is assigned a leader (former manager).   The leader is assigned the accountability. The team members   (former subordinates) wait for the leader to tell them what  to do so they can each do their part.
The labels may have changed, but the organizing metaphor  hasn't changed at all.

► Know that being in a good team isn't random. Instead,  it is a function of one's relationship behavior and  what you and others do.
► Take personal responsibility for the quality of their  relationships. They never wait for those "in charge"  to notice and act on a situation that needs attention.

Becoming consistently   more willing and able to respond (response-ability) to  whatever happens in your life and work is the key to personal  power and growth. It's also the key to productive relationships.
So, when I find myself in a non-productive or counter-productive  relationship, rather than deny, blame, or justify, I am likely to ask  myself, "How did I create this for myself? And now, how will I  respond to change it?"

Contrary to the popular definition, real "team players"  never "go along" with something about which they have strong  negative feelings. They retain and exercise their personal power  at all times. They remain conscious that authority relationships  are just agreements-consents-between people. When true  teammates disagree with teammates, partners, bosses, or elected  representatives, they push back, knowing that the group's final  direction will either represent their personal consent to that direction   or represent the place where they withdraw from the  group.

Our addiction to criticizing others is a huge block to effectively  giving feedback. When we criticize, even if we choose our  words with care, we are likely to assign others to a specific, potentially   harmful, status. We are likely to assign others, for instance,   to the status of being "wrong." No one likes to be  labeled "wrong." Most people get defensive when they are labeled,   even when sure they are not "wrong." And what's more  important, defensive people block messages.

we can practice TeamWisdom when it comes  time to end a relationship by taking the following five steps:
1. End the collaboration by bringing to mind the positive  intentions and positive results that the partnership  produced.
2. Thank your partners for the opportunities, results, and  trust they provided you.
3. Explain that you don't see any motivation to continue  investing in the relationship and that this does not mean  that either party should attempt to cause a loss for the  other.
4. Negotiate fairly and compassionately during the dismantling   of infrastructure and the redistribution of responsibilities.   Pay your fair share or more of these expenses.  If either party feels threatened, engage the services of a  facilitator.
5. If the other party exhibits difficult end-game behavior,  show compassionate provocability and strive for  resolution by de-escalating rather than escalating.

people are prone to mislabeling  certain types of business behavior "competitive" when they are  not. In fact, these types of behaviors are actually "antagonistic,"   a term which needs to be distinguished from "competitive."   Failing to maintain the distinction between antagonistic  and competitive can weigh heavily on the performance and  spirit of team members.

Step One: Assume personal responsibility for team productivity.   At your next opportunity, whether in individual informal  encounters or at a team meeting, announce to team members
that you will only do work that leads to the entire team's success.   Furthermore, announce that you will not be able to meet  your goals unless the team meets its goals, so it is in your best  interest for the team to be extremely productive and effective.  Finally, tell your teammates how you have decided to do everything   in your power to help the team gel and operate at superior   levels of performance.

Step Two: Get in the same boat together. At the next meeting,   ask teammates to put aside individual roles and have a conversation   about what you will collectively accomplish. For a  moment, think of the team as a single unit, indivisible into  smaller units, and answer this question: "What must this unit  do?" Insist on continuing this conversation until everyone  seems to share the same clarity about what the team has been  formed to do. After the function of the team has been established,   make that task focus your "super-objective" and give it  more importance than any other objective or goal.

Step Three: Determine "What's in it for me?" and then  "What's in it for you?" Once you know your super-objective,  sit down at your keyboard or with pen and paper and generate  a series of answers to this question: "What is in it for me to  pursue this task, assignment, or super-objective?" Keep asking  the question and writing down answers. Encourage yourself to  probe deeper and generate more possibilities. When you have a  complete list (five to ten answers), prioritize your responses  until you truly understand your motivation for serving on the  team. After you know what's in it for you, begin to ask your  teammates the same question. Ask them "What's in it for you  to pursue this task with this team?" Then wait patiently for responses.

Step Four: Make and keep agreements. Since you have  made your interests known, wouldn't you like to protect them?  While at your keyboard or sitting with pencil and paper, inventory   your "shoulds." These are the expectations you have about  how others "should" behave in your presence, in your teams,  or at meetings you attend. List them all.

Step Five: "Call it!" By this time you know how to craft the  foundational elements for TeamWisdom. But they are fragile  and must be protected. While the agreements are still fresh, ask  others if they will help you "call" each other on behavior that  is inconsistent with the team's task, team members' interests,  and your stated agreements.

If you take 100-percent responsibility   for the quality and productivity of every relationship   at work, then you will be truly committing yourself to the  path of discovery. This means forgiving rather than shaming  yourself when relationships don't work, refusing to blame unproductive   relationships solely on others' behavior, and eliminating   excuses about why it is okay to stay in an unproductive  relationship without attending to it.

Iterations improve product utility by giving regular feedback to customers. They increase visibility because they are touch points for reviews, and they provide constant, concrete feedback on the progress of the work. Iterations improve a team's flexibility by enabling members to change their minds based on feedback from previous work. There is little "work in progress" between Iterations. Finally, time to market is reduced because every time-boxed iteration is a potential release, and taking the software to the Done State regularly reveals defects early in the process for cheaper and faster removal.

Many analysts take up the role of the customer as part of the team because they are domain experts. This is great, but they should beware of the added responsibilities and constraints. The customer builds incremental requirements and needs to get out of the habit of eliciting large upfront requirements. The customer needs to be available to the rest of the development team for clarifications and conversations; this becomes a more time-consuming task than it is traditionally. If the team uses functional tests or test-driven requirements, the customer has to learn the testing language and be more precise in his requirements.

The Test-First Development practice involves writing tests before writing the production code that will support and eventually pass that test. Tests resulting from this practice tend to reflect a developer's understanding of requirements because there is no design at its inception. The production code written to satisfy the tests tends to be loosely coupled and simple, which are both excellent design qualities.

Very often, however, the mental models you form on your own aren’t completely accurate—you’re only one person, so your knowledge and experiences are limited. Education is a way to make your mental models more accurate by internalizing the knowledge and experiences other people have collected throughout their lives.

Value usually takes on one of twelve standard forms: 1. Product. Create a single tangible item or entity, then sell and deliver it for more than what it cost to make. 2. Service. Provide help or assistance, then charge a fee for the benefits rendered. 3. Shared Resource. Create a durable asset that can be used by many people, then charge for access. 4. Subscription. Offer a benefit on an ongoing basis, and charge a recurring fee. 5. Resale. Acquire an asset from a wholesaler, then sell that asset to a retail buyer at a higher price. 6. Lease. Acquire an asset, then allow another person to use that asset for a predefined amount of time in exchange for a fee. 7. Agency. Market and sell an asset or service you don’t own on behalf of a third party, then collect a percentage of the transaction price as a fee. 8. Audience Aggregation. Get the attention of a group of people with certain characteristics, then sell access in the form of advertising to another business looking to reach that audience. 9. Loan. Lend a certain amount of money, then collect payments over a predefined period of time equal to the original loan plus a predefined interest rate. 10. Option. Offer the ability to take a predefined action for a fixed period of time in exchange for a fee. 11. Insurance. Take on the risk of some specific bad thing happening to the policy holder in exchange for a predefined series of payments, then pay out claims only when the bad thing actually happens. 12. Capital. Purchase an ownership stake in a business, then collect a corresponding portion of the profit as a one-time payout or ongoing dividend.

And with that he sat down to rest on his laurels and consider his subterranean grandparents.

As a summary of systems thinking insight, we like the ‘laws’ described in The Fifth Discipline : • Today’s problems come from yesterday’s ‘solutions.’ • The harder you push, the harder the system pushes back. • Behavior will grow worse before it grows better. • The easy way out usually leads back in. • The cure can be worse than the disease. • Faster is slower. • Cause and effect are not closely related in time and space. • Small changes can produce big results...but the areas of highest leverage are often the least obvious. • You can have your cake and eat it too—but not all at once. • Dividing an elephant in half does not produce two small elephants. • There is no blame.

A classic example of the short-term ‘improving’ but long-term degrading dynamic is the story of the first release of Microsoft Word for Windows [Spolsky04]. It was released years later than desired. Why? Because managers tried to follow the original schedule and pushed developers to meet it. The story illustrates why wishful thinking is identified as one of the wastes in lean thinking. In this case the wishful thinking of insisting on (apparently) following a schedule, which implies the misconception or wishful thinking that development estimates are not estimates but are commitments—a common myth that propels degradation of a system.

“Everyone is doing their best yet overall systems throughput is degrading. How can that be?” This is the paradox of local optimization—when a person or departmental decision maker optimizes for the local view or self-interest. The party making the decision frequently believes they are making the best decision , but because ‘best’ is a local optimization, in fact it sub-optimizes overall system throughput. This is a result of “silo mentality,” misunderstanding, fear, limited information, delayed feedback, ignorance, careerism, avarice, and other common organizational learning disorders.

The English term ‘lean’ was chosen for the Toyota system—and popularized by MIT researchers of Toyota in The Machine That Changed the World [WJR90]—to contrast their lean production with the alternative of mass production. The implication was a dramatic reduction in work-package or batch size, and no longer competing on economies of scale but rather competing on the ability to adapt, avoid inventory, and work in very small units—themes also found in agile methods such as Scrum.

Go See not only implies walking to the source to find facts and decide with direct insight; it means—once you are there—to build consensus for goals and experiments to change. The full implication of Go See is for people—especially managers—to frequently spend time at the real place of value work, build relationships of trust with the people there, and help them fix things.

Kaizen is both a personal mindset and a practice. As a mindset, it suggests “My work is to do my work and to improve my work” and “continuously improve for its own sake.” More formally as a practice, kaizen implies: 1. choose and practice techniques the team and/or product group has agreed to try, until they are well understood 2. experiment until you find a better way 3. repeat forever

Step one in kaizen implies having patience through the awkward learning phase and not abandoning new techniques quickly. People need a valid baseline to improve against. And in Deming’s terminology, they need to be able to distinguish between common-cause and special-cause variability.

Shu Ha Ri is a model of progressive learning discussed in martial arts; its connection to kaizen and agile methods has been noted in [Cockburn01]. In phase one, Shu , a person follows rules until they sink in and become automatic. In phase two, Ha , a person reflects on the rules, looks for exceptions, and ‘breaks’ the rules. In phase three, Ri , the rules are essentially forgotten as the person has developed mastery, and grasped the essence and underlying forces.

Inventories of physical things or of intangible WIP—such as requirement specifications—imply investment without profit and hidden defects. That’s not good. However, a common practice in lean improvement is to create level pull, removing variability (one of the sources of waste) in a downstream process step by inserting a small buffer of high-quality “equally sized” inventory items before that downstream step. This is one purpose of the Scrum Product Backlog. It acts as a tool for leveling or smoothing the introduction of work to feature teams.

Flow suggests making value flow without delay to the customer. As a counter example, a customer request waits in a queue waiting to be approved, analyzed, implemented, reworked, or tested. That is not flow. Rather, as value is created—in products, software, information, decisions, service—it flows immediately to the customer.

In push planning , a large, upfront, detailed plan is created of what requirements will be done and when, and all tasks for these are estimated, sequenced, and assigned to people or teams—from the beginning until delivery. Then the tasks are pushed to the workers and there is an attempt to control toward the original speculative plan. Note that push planning requires that all requirements are therefore elaborately analyzed and detailed before planning (at least if done rationally), and it assumes low or no change, and no surprises.

In pull planning, or adaptive iterative planning, a Product Backlog of high-level requirements or goals is created. At “the last responsible moment”—the first day of a short timeboxed iteration—the Product Owner selects a list of small goals for the iteration, from a slightly larger set that was analyzed and estimated in the last one or two iterations. In response to this pull signal , the team builds and delivers what they can. Note that since the decision was made as late as possible, with fresh insight and maximum information in a variable world , more informed choices are made. Pull planning is related to what is also known as rolling wave planning.

Physical tokens.

It is when we stop believing that religions have been handed down from above or else that they are entirely daft that matters become more interesting. We can then recognize that we invented religions to serve two central needs which continue to this day and which secular society has not been able to solve with any particular skill: first, the need to live together in communities in harmony, despite our deeply rooted selfish and violent impulses. And second, the need to cope with terrifying degrees of pain which arise from our vulnerability to professional failure, to troubled relationships, to the death of loved ones and to our decay and demise.

The liturgical complexity of a missal – the directive way in which this book of instructions for the celebration of a Mass compels the congregants to look up, stand, kneel, sing, pray, drink and eat at given points – speaks to an essential aspect of human nature which benefits from being guided in how to behave with others.

This double insight – that we should train our minds just as we train our bodies, and that we should do so partly through those bodies – has led to the founding, by all the major faiths, of religious retreats where adherents may for a limited time abscond from their ordinary lives and find inner restoration through spiritual exercise.

most of the time, without having any choice in the matter, we are dominated by our ego, or, as it is termed in Sanskrit, our ātman. This centre of consciousness is by nature selfish, narcissistic and insatiable, unreconciled to its own mortality and driven to avoid the prospect of death by fantasizing about the redemptive powers of career, status and wealth. It is let loose like a demented dynamo at the moment of our birth and does not incline to rest until we breathe our last.

Christianity is not, in and of itself, an unhopeful institution. It merely has the good sense to locate its expectations firmly in the next life, in the moral and material perfection of a world far beyond this one. This relegation of hope to a distant sphere has enabled the Church to be uniquely clear-eyed and unsentimental about earthly reality. It does not assume that politics could ever create perfect justice, that any marriage could be free of conflict or dissent, that money could ever deliver security, that a friend could be unfailingly loyal or, more generally, that Heavenly Jerusalem could be built on ordinary ground.

The fundamental question which the modern museum has unusual but telling difficulty in answering is why art should matter.

But it subsequently retreats into a curious, institutional silence about what this importance might actually be based on. We are left feeling as though we must have missed out on crucial stages of an argument which the museum has in reality never made, beyond trailing a tautological contention that art should matter to us because it is so important.

Howard Gardner is widely known for having developed an initial list of seven intelligences: linguistic, logical-mathematical, musical, bodily kinesthetic, spatial, interpersonal, and intrapersonal intelligence. As researcher Mark Smith notes, “The first two have been typically valued in schools; the next three are usually associated with the arts; and the final two are what Howard Gardner called ‘personal intelligences.’” Smith observes that Gardner has considered additional forms of intelligence, including spiritual, naturalistic, moral, and existential, but thus far has concluded that there is only sufficient evidence to add naturalistic—or the ability to categorize and make use of one’s environment—to his original list of seven.

Worringer argued that we all grow up with something missing inside us. Our parents and our environment fail us in distinctive ways, and our characters hence take shape with certain areas of vulnerability and imbalance in them. And crucially, these deficits and flaws determine what is going to appeal to us and repel us in art.

Eroticism seems, in the end, to have very little to do with simply being unclothed: it springs instead from a promise of mutual arousal, an eventuality that may elude two people who are naked and in bed together or, conversely, may take hold of another pair as they are ascending a mountainside in a chairlift, dressed in thick ski suits, mittens and woollen hats.

The madonna/whore dichotomy has an exact analogy in the no-less-common nice-guy/bastard complex, wherein women recognize the theoretical appeal of warm, nurturing and communicative males but are at the same time unable to deny the superior sexual attraction of those cruel bandits who will take off for another continent the moment the lovemaking is finished.

A general “law of least effort” applies to cognitive as well as physical exertion. The law asserts that if there are several ways of achieving the same goal, people will eventually gravitate to the least demanding course of action. In the economy of action, effort is a cost, and the acquisition of skill is driven by the balance of benefits and costs. Laziness is built deep into our nature.

System 1 provides the impressions that often turn into your beliefs, and is the source of the impulses that often become your choices and your actions. It offers a tacit interpretation of what happens to you and around you, linking the present with the recent past and with expectations about the near future. It contains the model of the world that instantly evaluates events as normal or surprising. It is the source of your rapid and often precise intuitive judgments. And it does most of this without your conscious awareness of its activities.

Survival prospects are poor for an animal that is not suspicious of novelty. However, it is also adaptive for the initial caution to fade if the stimulus is actually safe. The mere exposure effect occurs, Zajonc claimed, because the repeated exposure of a stimulus is followed by nothing bad. Such a stimulus will eventually become a safety signal, and safety is good.

Overconfidence: As the WYSIATI rule implies, neither the quantity nor the quality of the evidence counts for much in subjective confidence. The confidence that individuals have in their beliefs depends mostly on the quality of the story they can tell about what they see, even if they see little.

We are pattern seekers, believers in a coherent world, in which regularities (such as a sequence of six girls) appear not by accident but as a result of mechanical causality or of someone’s intention. We do not expect to see regularity produced by a random process, and when we detect what appears to be a rule, we quickly reject the idea that the process is truly random.

the anchoring effect is reduced or eliminated when the second mover focuses his attention on the minimal offer that the opponent would accept, or on the costs to the opponent of failing to reach an agreement. In general, a strategy of deliberately “thinking the opposite” may be a good defense against anchoring effects, because it negates the biased recruitment of thoughts that produces these effects.

Anchoring effects have always been studied in tasks of judgment and choice that are ultimately completed by System 2. However, System 2 works on data that is retrieved from memory, in an automatic and involuntary operation of System 1. System 2 is therefore susceptible to the biasing influence of anchors that make some information easier to retrieve. Furthermore, System 2 has no control over the effect and no knowledge of it.

Tourists landing at the international terminal at LAX are met outside by friendly people with official-looking clipboards who offer to help with directions to the city. “Hey, where are you headed today?” they ask. “Can I be of assistance?” After they provide directions or answer questions from unsuspecting tourists, there’s a pitch: “I’m working today on behalf of a great organization. Can you help us out with a donation?” The implied message is, I just helped you . . . now it’s your turn.

Edison was not a loner. For the invention of the lightbulb, he had thirty assistants, including well-trained scientists, often working around the clock in a corporate-funded state-of-the-art laboratory! It did not happen suddenly. The lightbulb has become the symbol for that single moment when the brilliant solution strikes, but there was no single moment of invention. In fact, the lightbulb was not one invention, but a whole network of time-consuming inventions each requiring one or more chemists, mathematicians, physicists, engineers, and glassblowers.

in the fixed mindset, adolescence is one big test. Am I smart or dumb? Am I good-looking or ugly? Am I cool or nerdy? Am I a winner or a loser? And in the fixed mindset, a loser is forever. It’s no wonder that many adolescents mobilize their resources, not for learning, but to protect their egos. And one of the main ways they do this (aside from providing vivid portraits of their teachers) is by not trying.

During World War II, study groups of the State Department and Council on Foreign Relations developed plans for the postwar world in terms of what they called the “Grand Area,” which was to be subordinated to the needs of the American economy. The Grand Area was to include the Western Hemisphere, Western Europe, the Far East, the former British Empire (which was being dismantled), the incomparable energy resources of the Middle East (which were then passing into American hands as we pushed out our rivals France and Britain), the rest of the Third World and, if possible, the entire globe.

When the idea of a love-based marriage took hold in the eighteenth century, it replaced an older and more prosaic rationale for betrothal, whereby couples got married because they had both reached the proper age, found they could stand the sight of each other, were keen not to offend both sets of parents and their neighbours, had a few assets to protect and wished to raise a family. The bourgeoisie’s new philosophy, by contrast, legitimated only one reason for marriage: deep love.

When bosses become controlling and abusive, they put everyone into a fixed mindset. This means that instead of learning, growing, and moving the company forward, everyone starts worrying about being judged. It starts with the bosses’ worry about being judged, but it winds up being everybody’s fear about being judged. It’s hard for courage and innovation to survive a companywide fixed mindset.

Bullying is about judging. It’s about establishing who is more worthy or important. The more powerful kids judge the less powerful kids. They judge them to be less valuable human beings, and they rub their faces in it on a daily basis. And it’s clear what the bullies get out of it. Like the boys in Sheri Levy’s study, they get a boost in self-esteem. It’s not that bullies are low in self-esteem, but judging and demeaning others can give them a self-esteem rush. Bullies also gain social status from their actions. Others may look up to them and judge them to be cool, powerful, or funny. Or may fear them. Either way, they’ve upped their standing.

When we say to children, “Wow, you did that so quickly!” or “Look, you didn’t make any mistakes!” what message are we sending? We are telling them that what we prize are speed and perfection. Speed and perfection are the enemy of difficult learning: “If you think I’m smart when I’m fast and perfect, I’d better not take on anything challenging.” So what should we say when children complete a task—say, math problems—quickly and perfectly? Should we deny them the praise they have earned? Yes. When this happens, I say, “Whoops. I guess that was too easy. I apologize for wasting your time. Let’s do something you can really learn from!”

In this way, it provided a formula for self-esteem and a path to love and respect from others.

Arthur Schopenhauer suggested why this desire for money is so pervasive: ‘Men are often criticized that money is the chief object of their wishes and is preferred above all else, but it is natural and even unavoidable. For money is an inexhaustible Proteus, ever ready to change itself into the present object of our changeable wishes and manifold needs . . . Money is human happiness in the abstract.’

François-René de Chateaubriand made a similar point over a century ago: A master in the art of living draws no sharp distinction between his work and his play; his labour and his leisure; his mind and his body; his education and his recreation. He hardly knows which is which. He simply pursues his vision of excellence through whatever he is doing, and leaves others to determine whether he is working or playing. To himself, he always appears to be doing both.

Early researchers observed strong correlations between being able to fly and having feathers and wings. Stories of men attempting to fly by strapping on wings date back hundreds of years. They were replicating what they believed allowed birds to soar: wings and feathers. Possessing these attributes had a high correlation—a connection between two things—with the ability to fly, but when humans attempted to follow what they believed were “best practices” of the most successful fliers by strapping on wings, then jumping off cathedrals and flapping hard … they failed.

A strategy? At a basic level, a strategy is what you want to achieve and how you will get there. In the business world, this is the result of multiple influences: what a company’s priorities are, how a company responds to opportunities and threats along the way, and how a company allocates its precious resources. These things all continuously combine, to create and evolve a strategy.

Another student then added, “I don’t think you can pay Bruce an incentive—it’s against the policy of the company. Pay-for-performance bonuses are typically only given to general managers in business units, not to engineers, because it is at the managerial level where revenues and costs come together. Below that, employees have responsibility only for a piece of the puzzle, so incentives can throw things out of balance.”

Herzberg notes the common assumption that job satisfaction is one big continuous spectrum—starting with very happy on one end and reaching all the way down to absolutely miserable on the other—is not actually the way the mind works. Instead, satisfaction and dissatisfaction are separate, independent measures. This means, for example, that it’s possible to love your job and hate it at the same time.

The doctor of the day had no real remedies to speak of, administering herbal tinctures and elixirs with little success. He did, however, manage to cast a terrifying figure amid the chaos. In a flowing black robe, his face was covered by a freakishly elongated nose cone filled primarily with juniper. Looking like nothing so much as an enormous beak, this protective mask inspired the evolution of the term ‘quack’ for a doctor of ill repute.

Around 1730, genever was shipped with herbs known as lepelblad, or ‘scurvy-grass’, to prevent the then-deadly affliction of scurvy. Furthermore, from 1742 on the Chamber Amsterdam of the voc ordered genever to replace korenbrandewijn, which had been used since the 1600s, because the juniper berries used in genever were considered healthful. Even as late as 1863, a medical directive considered genever rations to be ‘effective medicine’.

Most complex systems fall apart at the boundaries between departments, where ambiguities as to what is needed by one department or what is to be done by another department create a series of small problems. When ignored, these small failures, over time, line up in just the wrong way and eventually produce a catastrophic failure.

A low-velocity company would think of a schedule as a plan and measure variance against that plan, engaging in the static process of predicting what it will take to meet the goal. High-velocity organizations are not in the business of making predictions; instead, they would regard a schedule as a hypothesis of what it might take to meet the goal. When there is a variance from schedule, the hypothesis would be disproved; it would be obvious that the schedule isn’t perfect.

Framing process standards in this manner carries the implicit assumption that once processes are sufficiently commoditized (de-skilled), anyone should be able to do any job—so people become fungible resources.

it should be blindingly obvious why we struggle when trying to apply management practices developed for manual labor to knowledge work.

Counting the quantity of the “things” knowledge workers produce—for example, how many stories were completed—is sort of like measuring how many students a teacher has in a class.

You start by making sure that work is structured so that it is a system—one that gives knowledge workers visibility into the needs and expectations of your customers. Then you focus on developing the technical capability of the system and of the people developing your products. You structure your delivery system so that workflows are steady and predictable.

The norm of reciprocity suggests that when employers provide wages, benefits, and training that are perceived to be generous, employees are likely to reciprocate with increased discretionary effort. And if companies cut back on things employees have come to expect, employees are likely to cut back on their effort and loyalty to maintain a fair balance.

Every successful product or service, either explicitly or implicitly, was structured around a job to be done. Addressing a job is the causal mechanism behind a purchase. If someone develops a product that is interesting, but which doesn’t intuitively map in customers’ minds on a job that they are trying to do, that product will struggle to succeed—unless the product is adapted and repositioned on an important job.

It started at the simplest of activities in the value chain, then, decision by decision, every time that Dell outsourced the next lowest-value-adding of the remaining activities in its business, Asus added a higher value-adding activity to its business. All along, the numbers had looked good to Dell. But what the numbers had not shown was the impact these decisions would have on Dell’s future.

Every time an executive in an established company needs to make an investment decision, there are two alternatives on the menu. The first is the full cost of making something completely new. The second is to leverage what already exists, so that you only need to incur the marginal cost and revenue. Almost always, the marginal-cost argument overwhelms the full-cost. For the entrant, in contrast, there is no marginal-cost item on the menu. If it makes sense, then you do the full-cost alternative. Because they are new to the scene, in fact, the full cost is the marginal cost.

Semler writes: Profit is highly important to us at Semco, and we’re as avid about it as a general is about his supplies. If provisions run out, his soldiers will die. If a company ceases to make money, it too will die. But armies are not created to feed soldiers, just as companies don’t generate income just so they can hire more employees. Food fuels the soldiers and keeps them going. Yet to serve as more than mere gun fodder, they must have a higher purpose, a reason for going through boot camp and charging the enemy in battle. This is where profit and purpose meet and, unfortunately for most organizations, it’s a head-on Humvee wreck.

Connected companies are loosely-joined networks of semi-autonomous pods. Since pods aren’t coordinated from above, you want to create the conditions that allow them to self-organize and coordinate their own activity. That means they need as much information about each other’s actions and the conditions of their environment as possible. This is known as situation awareness — the ability to perceive and understand the context

Today’s development organizations are managed like centrally-controlled economies of the twentieth century. Resource is allocated by an infinitely wise centralized decision maker. There is no explicit cost for requesting priority or excess resource. In theory, the decision maker has the scarce global knowledge needed to allocate resources. In reality, this creates a massive incentive for projects to exaggerate their needs. Skillful lobbying can often get more resources than legitimate needs.

The behavior of linked queues is interesting because the departure process for one queue becomes the arrival process for the next one. Depending on the size of the queue at a process, its output pattern will either look more like its arrival pattern or its service pattern. In effect, the queue can function as a buffer isolating the variability of the arrival pattern from the departure pattern.

To roughly assess whether a different queuing discipline could improve your economics, ask three questions. First, is there a difference in the cost of delay of different jobs in the queue? Second, is there a difference in the time a job will block a resource? Third, is the average length of the queue large? In most product development processes, all three of these conditions apply, so we can make money with better queueing discipline.

Marketing is a common source of queueing at the front end of the development process. Marketing usually has a mismatch between capacity and demand. Capacity is restricted because marketing resources tend to be spread across many opportunities with a low duty-cycle on each activity. Demand is high because most organizations like to have a surplus of opportunities. This leads to queues that are typically unmeasured and unmanaged.

Analysis frequently has queues because of high capacity-utilization and high variability. Capacity is scarce because resources are highly specialized and expensive. Although demand is only limited, it is extremely variable. This creates queues, but this queue size and its associated flow time are rarely monitored. Instead, analysis resources are typically measured and incentivized on efficiency, which reinforces the queues.

Testing is probably the single most common critical-path queue in most R&D organizations. It is also one of the most dangerous, because it is on the critical path near the end of the development process. Its queues are caused by limited capacity and variable demand. Testing also has queues, because tests are often done with larger batch sizes than are desirable.

When our task list becomes very granular, the noise in each estimate is very high compared to the signal.

The movement in software to daily build/test cycles is underpinned by test automation. As we automate our tests, we can use smaller test batches. This, in turn, creates a virtuous cycle. The smaller the batch, the more batches we must do; the more batches we do, the more we can justify investing in automation.

Another common batch size error is the way projects are funded. The entire project is conceived and funded as a single large batch proposal. Since this large proposal requests a large investment, risk is high. To control this high risk, sensible managers demand thorough analysis and careful justification. This large transaction cost biases people towards minimizing the number of transactions and maximizing transaction size. Since it takes almost equal effort to ask for a big bag of money as a small one, people prefer to ask for big bags of money.

When we set a limit on WIP, we create one positive effect and two negative ones. The positive effect is to reduce average cycle time. The first negative effect is that we permanently reject potentially valuable demand. The second negative effect is that we ultimately reduce our capacity utilization, because we have permanently lost the demand that we rejected during periods of congestion.

The purpose of controlling product development is to efficiently influence overall economic outcomes. How can we do this? We need to find proxy variables that have strong transfer functions to overall economic results. Then, we need to find a way to efficiently influence these proxy variables. In some cases we can influence the proxy variable directly. In other cases, we must do this indirectly through an intermediate control variable.

entrepreneurs naturally focus on what they know best—their plans and actions and the most immediate threats and opportunities, such as the availability of funding. They know less about their competitors and therefore find it natural to imagine a future in which the competition plays little part.

Whenever you form a global evaluation of a complex object—a car you may buy, your son-in-law, or an uncertain situation—you assign weights to its characteristics. This is simply a cumbersome way of saying that some characteristics influence your assessment more than others do. The weighting occurs whether or not you are aware of it; it is an operation of System 1.

As predicted by denominator neglect, low-probability events are much more heavily weighted when described in terms of relative frequencies (how many) than when stated in more abstract terms of “chances,” “risk,” or “probability” (how likely). As we have seen, System 1 is much better at dealing with individuals than categories.

Pictures may be useful to the remembering self—though we rarely look at them for very long, or as often as we expected, or even at all—but picture taking is not necessarily the best way for the tourist’s experiencing self to enjoy a view.

Mood at work, for example, is largely unaffected by the factors that influence general job satisfaction, including benefits and status. More important are situational factors such as an opportunity to socialize with coworkers, exposure to loud noise, time pressure (a significant source of negative affect), and the immediate presence of a boss (in our first study, the only thing that was worse than being alone).

In the useful term introduced by Daniel Gilbert and Timothy Wilson, the decision to get married reflects, for many people, a massive error of affective forecasting. On their wedding day, the bride and the groom know that the rate of divorce is high and that the incidence of marital disappointment is even higher, but they do not believe that these statistics apply to them.

Where will you do it? How will you do it? Think about it in vivid detail.

If you really want to change your behaviour, then don’t try to make your self stop. This strategy will only rebound and make you more vulnerable. Instead, find an alternative to replace the activity. Not only does this provide a different scenario to occupy your activity, but it avoids the curse of ego-depletion.
